<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>THE YOUNG MAN NEXT DOOR</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">My</span> story begins with an incident that is bound to happen
some time in any household that boasts&mdash;or perhaps
deplores&mdash;a high-spirited girl of twenty-three in it.</p>

<p>It begins with "a row" about a young man.</p>

<p>My story begins, too, where the first woman's story
began&mdash;in a garden.</p>

<p>It was the back garden of our red-roofed villa in
that suburban street, Laburnum Grove, Putney, S.W.</p>

<p>Now all those eighty-five neat gardens up and down
the leafy road are one exactly like the other, with the
same green strip of lawn just not big enough for tennis,
the same side borders gay with golden calceolaria, scarlet
geranium, blue lobelia, and all the bright easy-to-grow
London flowers. All the villas belonging to the gardens
seem alike, too, with their green front doors, their
white steps, their brightly polished door-knockers and
their well-kept curtains.</p>

<p>From the look of these typically English, cheerful,
middle-class, not-too-well-off little homes you'd know
just the sort of people who live in them. The plump,
house-keeping mother, the season-ticket father, the
tennis-playing sons, the girls in dainty blouses, who put
their little newly whitened shoes to dry on the bathroom
window-sill, and who call laughing remarks to each other
out of the window.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;2]</span>
"I say, Gladys! don't forget it's the theatre to-night!"</p>

<p>"Oh, rather not! See you up at the Tennis Club
presently?"</p>

<p>"No; I'm meeting Vera to shop and have lunch in
Oxford Street."</p>

<p>"Dissipated rakes! '<i>We don't have much money,
but we do see life</i>,' eh?"</p>

<p>Yes! From what I see of them, they do get heaps
of fun out of their lives, these young people who make
up such a large slice of the population of our great
London. There's laughter and good-fellowship and
enjoyment going on all up and down our road.</p>

<p>Except here. No laughter and parties and tennis
club appointments at No. 45, where I, Beatrice Lovelace,
live with my Aunt Anastasia. No gay times
<i>here</i>!</p>

<p>When we came here six years ago (I was eighteen)
Aunt Anastasia was <i>rigidly</i> firm about our having absolutely
nothing to do with the people of the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>"They are not <span class="smcap">our</span> kind," she said with her stately,
rather thin grey-haired head in the air. "And though
we may have come down in the world, we are still Lovelaces,
as we were in the old days when your dear grandfather
had Lovelace Court. Even if we do seem to have
dropped out of <span class="smcap">our</span> world, we need not associate with
any other. Better <i>no</i> society than the wrong society."</p>

<p>So, since "our" world takes no further notice of us,
we have no society at all. I can't <i>tell</i> you how frightfully,
increasingly, indescribably dull and lonely it all is!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;3]</span>
I simply long for somebody fresh of my own age to
talk to. And I see so many of them about here!</p>

<p>"It's like starving in the midst of plenty," I said to
myself this evening as I was watering the pinks in the
side borders. The girls at No. 46, to the right of
our garden, were shrieking with laughter together on
their lawn over some family joke or other&mdash;I listened
enviously to their merriment.</p>

<p>I wondered which of them was getting teased, and
whether it was the one with my own name, Beatrice&mdash;I
know some of them by name as well as I know them
by sight, the pretty, good-humoured-looking girls who
live in this road, the cheery young men! And yet, in all
these years, I've never been allowed to have a neighbour
or an acquaintance. I've never exchanged a single&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Good evening!" said a pleasant, man's voice into
the midst of my reverie.</p>

<p>Startled, I glanced up.</p>

<p>The voice came over the palings between our garden
and that of No. 44. Through the green trellis that
my aunt had had set up over the palings ("so that we
should be more private") I beheld a gleam of white
flannel-clad shoulders and of smooth, fair hair.</p>

<p>It was the young man who's lately come to live next
door.</p>

<p>I've always thought he looked rather nice, and
rather as if he would like to say good morning or something
whenever I've met him going by.</p>

<p>I suppose I ought not to have noticed even that?
And, of course, according to my upbringing, I ought
certainly not to have noticed him now. I ought to
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;4]</span>
have fixed a silent, Medusa-like glare upon the trellis.
I ought then to have taken my battered little green
watering-can to fill it for the fourteenth time at the
scullery-tap. Then I ought to have begun watering
the Shirley poppies on the other side of the
garden.</p>

<p>But how often the way one's been brought up contradicts
what one feels like doing! And alas! How
very often the second factor wins the day!</p>

<p>It won the evening, that time.</p>

<p>I said: "Good evening."</p>

<p>And I thought that would be the end of it, but no.</p>

<p>The frank and boyish voice (quite as nice a voice
as my soldier-brother Reggie's, far away in India!)
took up quite quickly and eagerly: "Er&mdash;I say, isn't
it rather a long job watering the garden that way?"</p>

<p>It was, of course. But we couldn't afford a hose.
Why, they cost about thirty shillings.</p>

<p>He said: "Do have the 'lend' of our hose to do
the rest of them, won't you?" And thereupon he
stretched out a long, white-sleeved arm over the railings
and put the end of the hose straight into my
hand.</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you; but I will not trouble you. Good
evening."</p>

<p>Of course, that would have been the thing to say,
icily, before I walked off.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I only got as far as "Oh, thank
you&mdash;&mdash;" And then my fingers must have fumbled
the tap on or something. Anyhow, a great spray of
water immediately poured forth from out of the hose
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;5]</span>
through the roses and the trellis, right on to the fair
head and the face of the young man next door.</p>

<p>"Oh!" I cried, scarlet with embarrassment. "I beg
your pardon&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's quite all right, thanks," he said. "Most refreshing!"</p>

<p>Here I realised that I was still giving him a shower-bath
all the time.</p>

<p>Then we both laughed heartily together. It was the
first good laugh I'd had for months! And then I trained
the hose off him at last and on to our border, while
the young man, watching me from over the palings,
said quickly:</p>

<p>"I've been wanting to talk to you, do you know?
I've been wanting to ask&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Well, I suppose I shall never know now, what he
wanted to ask. For that was the moment when there
broke upon the peaceful evening air the sound of a
voice from the back window of our drawing-room, calling
in outraged accents:</p>

<p>"Beatrice! Bee&mdash;atrice!"</p>

<p>Immediately all the laughter went out of me.</p>

<p>"Y&mdash;yes, Aunt Anastasia," I called back. In my
agitation I dropped the end of the hose on to the
ground, where it began irrigating the turf and my
four-and-elevenpenny shoes at the same time.</p>

<p>"Beatrice, come in here instantly," called my aunt
in a voice there was no gainsaying.</p>

<p>So, leaving the hose where it lay, and without another
glance at the trellis, in I dashed through the
French window into our drawing-room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;6]</span>
A queer mixture of a room it is. So like us; so
typical of our circumstances! A threadbare carpet
and the cheapest bamboo easy-chairs live cheek-by-jowl
with a priceless Chippendale cabinet from Lovelace
Court, holding a few pieces of china that represent
the light of other days. Upon the faded cheap wallpaper
there hangs the pride of our home, the
Gainsborough portrait of one chestnut-haired, slim-throated
ancestress, Lady Anastasia Lovelace, in white
muslin and a blue sash, painted on the terrace steps at
Lovelace Court.</p>

<p>This was the background to the figure of my Aunt
Anastasia, who stood, holding herself as stiff as a poker
(she is very nearly as slim, even though she's fifty-three)
in her three-year-old grey alpaca gown with
the little eightpence-three-farthings white collar fastened
by her pearl brooch with granny's hair in it.</p>

<p>Her face told me what to expect. A heated flush,
and no lips. One of Auntie's worst tempers!</p>

<p>"Beatrice!" she exclaimed in a low, agitated tone.
"I am ashamed of you. I am ashamed of you." She
could not have said it more fervently if I'd been
found forging cheques. "After all my care! To
see you hobnobbing like a housemaid with these
people!"</p>

<p>Aunt Anastasia always mentions the people here as
who should say "the worms in the flower-beds" or
"the blight upon the rambler-roses."</p>

<p>"I wasn't hobnobbing, Auntie," I defended myself.
"Er&mdash;he only offered me the hose to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The thinnest of excuses," put in my aunt, curling
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;7]</span>
what was left visible of her lips. "You need not have
taken the hose."</p>

<p>"He put it right into my hand."</p>

<p>"Insufferable young bounder," exclaimed Aunt
Anastasia, still more bitterly.</p>

<p>I felt myself flushing hotly.</p>

<p>"Auntie, why do you always call everybody that
who is not ourselves?" I ventured. "'Honour
bright,' the young man didn't do it in a bounder-y
way at all. I'm sure he only meant to be nice and
neighbourly and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That will do, Beatrice. That will do," said my
Aunt majestically. "I am extremely displeased with
you. After all that I have said to you on the subject
of having nothing to do with the class of person among
which we are compelled to live, you choose to forget
yourself over&mdash;over a garden wall, and a hose, forsooth.</p>

<p>"For the future, kindly remember that you are my
niece"&mdash;(impressively)&mdash;"that you are your poor
father's child"&mdash;(more impressively)&mdash;"and that you
are Lady Anastasia's great-granddaughter"&mdash;(this
most impressively of all, with a stately gesture towards
the Gainsborough portrait hanging over the most
rickety of bamboo tables). "Our circumstances may
be straitened now. We may be banished to an odious
little hovel in the suburbs among people whom we cannot
possibly know, even if the walls are so thin that we can
hear them cleaning their teeth next door. There is no
disgrace in being poor, Beatrice. The disgrace lies in behaving
as if you did not still belong to our family!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;8]</span>
Aunt Anastasia always pronounces these last two
words as if they were written in capital letters, and
as if she were uttering them in church.</p>

<p>"I am going to the library now to change my
books," she concluded with much dignity. "During my
absence you will occupy yourself by making the salad
for supper."</p>

<p>"Yes, Auntie," I said in the resigned tone that so
often covers seething rebellion. Then a sudden thought
struck me, and I suggested: "Hadn't I&mdash;hadn't I better
return that hose? It is simply pouring itself out all
over the lawn still&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I will return the hose," said my aunt, in the tragic
tones of Mrs. Siddons playing Lady Macbeth and saying
"Give me the dagger!"</p>

<p>She stepped towards the back window.</p>

<p>I didn't feel equal to seeing the encounter between
Aunt Anastasia in her most icily formal mood and the
young man with the nice voice, of whom I caught
white-and-gold glimpses hovering about on the other
side of the green trellis.</p>

<p>I knew she'd be rude to him, as only "our families"
can be rude to those whom they consider "bounders."
He's nothing to me. I've never spoken to him
before this evening. I oughtn't to mind what he thinks
about those weird people who live at No. 45. I
oughtn't to wonder what it was he was just going to
say to me.</p>

<p>So I fled out of the bamboo and heirloom furnished
drawing-room, down the narrow little oil-clothed passage,
and into the kitchen with its heartening smell
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;9]</span>
of hot gooseberry tart and the cheerful society of
Million, our little maid-of-all-work. It's the custom of
our family to call the maid by her surname.</p>

<p>(At the same time I couldn't help wondering what
that young man had been going to say.)</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>TWO GIRLS IN A KITCHEN</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Little</span> Million, looking very cheery and trim in her
black gown and her white apron, and the neat little
cap perched upon her glossy black hair, smiled welcomingly
upon me as I came into the kitchen.</p>

<p>I like Million's nice smile and her Cockney chatter
about the Soldiers' Orphanage where she was brought
up and trained for domestic service, and about her
places before she came here. Aunt Anastasia considers
that it is so demoralising to gossip with the lower
orders. But Millions is the only girl of my own age
in London with whom I have the chance of gossiping!</p>

<p>She likes me, too. She considers that Miss Beatrice
treats her as if she were a human being instead of a
machine. She tossed the paper-covered Celandine Novelette
that she had been reading into the drawer of the
kitchen-table among the lead spoons and the skewers
and the cooking-forks, and then she spread the table
with a clean tea-cloth, and brought out the colander
with the lettuce and the cucumber and the cress that I
was going to cut up into salad; doing everything as if
she liked helping me.</p>

<p>"There, now! What a mercy I left the kitchen window
open. Now I haven't seen the new moon through
the glass!" she exclaimed, as she put all ready before
me&mdash;the hard-boiled egg, the mustard, sugar, pepper,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;11]</span>
salt, oil, and vinegar&mdash;for me to make the salad-dressing.
"Miss Beatrice, look at it through the open
window&mdash;there, just to the right of that little pink
cloud&mdash;turn your money, and you'll get a wish."</p>

<p>I peeped out of the window, and caught sight of
that slender festoon of silver swung in the sky above
the roses of the garden trellis.</p>

<p>"I've no money to turn," I smiled ruefully, "never
have."</p>

<p>"Turn some o' mine, Miss," said Million. "I've got
four-and-six here that I'm going to put into the Post
Office Savings Bank to-morrow." Million is extraordinarily
thrifty. "There you are. Wished your wish,
Miss Beatrice?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I've wished it," I said. "Always the same
wish with me, you know, Million. Always a perfectly
hopeless one. It's always, always that some millionaire
may leave me a fortune one day, and that I shall
be very rich, rolling in money."</p>

<p>"D'you think so much of money, then, Miss Beatrice?"
said Million, bustling over the black-and-white
chequered linoleum to the range, and setting the lid
on to her saucepan full of potatoes. "Rich people
aren't always happy&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's their own fault for not knowing how to
spend the money!"</p>

<p>"Ah, but I was readin' a sweetly pretty tale all about
that just now. 'Love or Money,' that was the name of
it," said Million, nodding at the kitchen-table drawer
in which she keeps her novelettes, "and it said these
very words: 'Money doesn't buy everythin'.'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;12]</span>
"H'm! It would buy most of the things I want!"
I declared as I sliced away at my cucumber. "The
lovely country house where I'd have crowds of people,
all kinds of paralysingly interesting people to stay
with me! The heavenly times in London, going everywhere
and seeing everything! The motors! And, oh,
Million"&mdash;I heard my voice shake with yearning as I
pronounced the magic name of what every woman thinks
of when she thinks of having money&mdash;"oh, Million, the
clothes I'd get! If I had decent clothes I'd be decent-looking.
I know I should."</p>

<p>"Why, Miss Beatrice, I've always thought you was
a very nice-looking young lady, anyhow," said our little
maid staunchly. "And to-night you're really pretty;
I was just passing the remark to myself when you
came in. Look at yourself in my little glass&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>I looked at myself in the mirror from the sixpence-ha'penny
bazaar. I saw a small, pink, heart-shaped
face with large brown eyes, eyes set wide apart and
full of impatience and eagerness for life. I saw a quantity
of bright chestnut hair, done rather "anyhow."
I saw a long, slender, white throat&mdash;just the throat of
Lady Anastasia&mdash;sloping down into shoulders that are
really rather shapely. Only how can anything on earth
look shapely under the sort of blouse that Aunt Anastasia
gets for me? Or the sort of serge skirt? Or
the shoes?</p>

<p>I glanced down at those four-and-elevenpenny canvas
abominations that were still sopping from the gardening
hose, and I said with fervour: "If I had money,
I'd have three pairs of new shoes for every day in the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;13]</span>
week. And each pair should cost as much as all my
clothes have cost this year!"</p>

<p>"Fancy that, now. That's not the kind of thing as
I'd care for myself. Extravagant&mdash;that's a thing I
couldn't be," declared Million, in her cheerful, matter-of-fact
little voice, sweeping up the hearth as she spoke.
"Legacies and rolling in money&mdash;and a maid to myself,
and bein' called 'Miss Million,' and all that. That
'ud never be my wish!"</p>

<p>"What was your wish, then?" I asked, beginning
to tear up the crisp leaves of the lettuce into the
glass salad-bowl. "I've told you mine, Million. Tell
me yours."</p>

<p>"Sure, you won't let on to any one if I do?" returned
our little maid, putting her black, white-capped
head on one side like a little bird. "Sure you won't
go and make game of me afterwards to your Aunt Nasturtium&mdash;oh,
lor'. Hark at me, now!&mdash;to Miss Lovelace,
I mean? If there's one thing that does make me
feel queer it's thinking folks are making game of me."</p>

<p>"I promise I won't. Tell me the wish!"</p>

<p>Million laughed again, coloured, twiddled her apron.
Then, leaning over the deal table towards me, she murmured
unexpectedly and bashfully: "I always wish
that I could marry a gentleman!"</p>

<p>"A gentleman?" I echoed, rather taken aback.</p>

<p>"Of course, I know," explained Million, "that a
young girl in my walk of life has plenty of chances
of getting married. Not like a young lady in yours,
Miss. Without a young lady like you has plenty of
money there's a very poor choice of husbands!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;14]</span>
"There is, indeed," I sighed.</p>

<p>The little maid went on: "So I could have some
sort of young man any day, Miss Beatrice. There's
the postman here&mdash;very inclined to be friendly&mdash;not
to mention the policeman. And the young man who
used to come round to attend to the gas at the Orphanage
when I was there. He writes to me still."</p>

<p>"And do you write back to him?"</p>

<p>"Picture postcards of Richmond Park. That's all
he's ever had from me. He's not the sort of young
man I'd like. You see, Miss, I've seen other sorts,"
said Million. "Where I was before I came here there
was three sons of the house, and seein' so much of them
gave me a sort of cri&mdash;terion, like. One was in the
Navy. Oh, Miss, he was nice. Oh, the way he talked.
It was better than 'The Flag Lieutenant.' It's a fact,
I'd rather listen to his voice than any one's on the
stage, d'you know.</p>

<p>"The two others were at Oxford College. And oh,
their lovely ties, and the jolly, laughing sort of ways
they had, and how they used to open the door for their
mother, and to sing in the bathroom of a morning.
Well! I dunno what it was, quite. Different," said little
Million vaguely, with her wistfully ambitious grey eyes
straying out of the kitchen window again. "I did like
it. And that's the sort of gentleman I'd like to marry."</p>

<p>She turned to the oven again, and moved the gooseberry
tart to the high shelf.</p>

<p>I said, smiling at her: "Million, any 'gentleman'
ought to be glad to marry you for your pastry alone."</p>

<p>"Oh, lor', Miss, I'm not building on it," said Million
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;15]</span>
brightly. "A sergeant's daughter? A girl in service?
Why, what toff would ever think of her? 'Tisn't as if
I was on the stage, where it doesn't seem to matter
what you've been. Or as if I was 'a lovely mill-hand,'
like in those tales where they always marry the son
of the owner of the works. So what's the good of me
thinking? Not but what I make up dreams in my
head, sometimes," admitted Million, "of what I'd do
and say&mdash;if 'He' did and said!"</p>

<p>"All girls have those dreams, Million," I told her,
"whether they're maids or mistresses."</p>

<p>"Think so, Miss Beatrice?" said our little maid.
"Well, I suppose I'm as likely to get my wish of
marrying a gentleman as you are of coming in for a
fortune. Talking of gentlemen, have you noticed the
tall, fair one who's come to live at No. 44? Him that
plays the pianoler of an evening? In a City office he
is, their girl told me. Wanted to get into the Army,
but there wasn't enough money. Well, he's one of the
sort I'd a-liked. A real gentleman, I call him."</p>

<p>And Auntie calls him an insufferable young bounder!</p>

<p>Funny, funny world where people give such different
names to the same thing!</p>

<p>I can see it's going to take Aunt Anastasia a week
before she forgives me the incident of the young man
next door!</p>

<p>Supper this evening was deathly silent; except for
the scrunching over my salad, just like footsteps on
the gravel. After supper we sat speechless in the drawing-room.
I darned my holey tan cashmere stockings.</p>

<p>Auntie read her last book from the library, "Rambles
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;16]</span>
in Japan." She's always reading books of travel&mdash;"Our
Trip to Turkey," "A Cycle in Cathay,"
"Round the World in a Motor-boat," and so on. Poor
dear! She would so adore travelling! And she'll never
get the chance except in print. Once I begged her to
sell the Gainsborough portrait of Lady Anastasia, and
take out the money in having a few really ripping tours.
I thought she would have withered me with her look.</p>

<p>She'll never do anything so desperately disrespectful
to our family. She'll never do anything, in fact.
Nothing will ever happen. Life will just go on and
on, and we shall go on too, getting older, and shabbier,
and more "select," and duller. They say that fortune
knocks once in a lifetime at every one's door. But
I'm sure there'll never be a knock at the door of No. 45
Laburnum Grove, except&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Tot&mdash;Tot!"</p>

<p>Ah! the postman. Then Million's quick step into
the hall. Then nothing further. No letters for us?
The letter must have been for our little maid. Perhaps
from the young man who attended to the Orphanage
gas? Happy Million, to have even an unwanted
young man to write to her!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>A BOLT FROM THE BLUE</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Oh!</span> to think that fortune should have given its knock
at the door of No. 45 after all! To think that this is
how it should have happened! Of all the unexpected
thunderbolts! And after that irresponsible talk about
money and legacies and wishes this evening in the
kitchen, and to think that Destiny had even then shuffled
the cards that she has just dealt!</p>

<p>It was ten minutes after the postman had been that
we heard a flurried tap on the drawing-room door, and
Million positively burst into the room. She was wide-eyed,
scarlet with excitement. She held a letter out
towards us with a gesture as if she were afraid it might
explode in her hand.</p>

<p>"What is this, Million?" demanded my aunt, severely,
over the top of her "Rambles."</p>

<p>"Oh, Miss Lovelace!" gasped our little maid. "Oh,
Miss Beatrice! I don't rightly know if I'm standing
on my head or my heels. I don't know if I've got the
right hang of this at all. Will you&mdash;will you please
read it for me?"</p>

<p>I took the letter.</p>

<p>I read it through without taking any of it in, as so
often happens when something startling meets one's eyes.</p>

<p>Million's little fluttered voice queried, "What do you
make of that, Miss?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;18]</span>
"I don't know. Wait a minute. I must read it over
again," I gasped in turn. "May I read it aloud?"</p>

<p>Million, clutching her starched white apron, nodded.</p>

<p>I read it aloud, this letter of Destiny.</p>

<p>It bore the address of a lawyer's office in Chancery
Lane, and it began:</p>

<p class="blockquot0">"<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Miss Nellie Million</span>.</p>

<p class="blockquot1">"Dear Madam:&mdash;I am instructed to inform you that
under the will of your late uncle, Mr. Samuel Million,
of Chicago, U.S.A., you have been appointed heiress
to his fortune of one million dollars.</p>

<p class="blockquot1">"I shall be pleased to call upon you and to await
your instructions, if you will kindly acquaint me with
your present address&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That was sent to the Orphanage," whispered Million.</p>

<p class="blockquot0">"or I should be very pleased to meet you if you would
make it convenient to come and call upon me here at
my offices at any time which may suit you. I am,
Madam,</p>

<p class="blockquotc">"Yours obediently,</p>

<p class="blockquotr">"<span class="smcap">Josiah Chesterton</span>."</p>

<p>There was silence in our drawing-room. Million's
little face turned, with a positively scared expression,
from Aunt Anastasia to me.</p>

<p>"D'you think it's true, Miss?"</p>

<p>"Have you ever heard of this Mr. Samuel Million
before?"</p>

<p>"Only that he was poor dad's brother that quarrelled
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;19]</span>
with him for enlisting. I heard he was in America,
gettin' on well&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That class," murmured my Aunt Anastasia with
concentrated resentment, "always gets on!"</p>

<p>That was horrid of her!</p>

<p>I didn't know how to make it up to Million. I put
out both hands and took her little roughened hands.</p>

<p>"Million, I do congratulate you. I believe it's true,"
I said heartily, finding my voice at last. "You'll have
heaps of money now. Everything you want. A millionaire's
heiress, that's what you are!"</p>

<p>"Me, miss?" gasped the bewildered-looking Million.
"Me, and not you, that wanted money? Me an heiress?
Oh, lor'! whatever next?"</p>

<p>The next morning&mdash;the morning after that startling
avalanche of news had been precipitated into the monotonous
landscape of our daily lives&mdash;I accompanied Million
to the lawyer's office, where she was to hear further
particulars of her unexpected, her breath-taking, her
epic legacy.</p>

<p>A million dollars! Two hundred thousand pounds!
And all for the little grey-eyed, black-haired daughter
of a sergeant in a line regiment, brought up in a soldiers'
orphanage to domestic service at £20 a year!
To think of it!</p>

<p>I could see my Aunt Anastasia thinking of it&mdash;with
bitterness, with envy.</p>

<p>It was she who ought to have taken Million to that
office in Chancery Lane.</p>

<p>But she&mdash;the mistress of the house&mdash;excused herself
by saying it was her morning for doing the silver.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;20]</span>
We left her in the kitchen surrounded by what I
am irreverent enough to call the relics of our family's
grandeur&mdash;the Queen Anne tea service, the Early
Georgian forks and spoons that have been worn and
polished fragile and thin. Indeed, one teaspoon is
broken. Aunt Anastasia took to her bed on the day
of that accident. And the maid we had before Million
scoured my grandfather's Crimean medal so heartily
that soon there would have been nothing left to see on
it. Since then my aunt has tended the relics with her
own hands.</p>

<p>We left her brooding darkly over the injustice that
had brought fortune to a wretched little maid-of-all-work
and poverty to our family; we hailed the big white
motor-'bus at the top of the road by the subscription
library, and dashed up the steps to the front seat.</p>

<p>"There! Bit of all right, this, ain't it, Miss Beatrice!"
gasped Million ecstatically.</p>

<p>Stars of delight shone in each grey eye as she settled
herself down on the tilted seat. I thought that this
change of expression was because she had thought over
her marvellous good fortune during the night, and because
she had begun to realise a little what it would all
mean to her. But I was quite wrong. Million, peering
down over the side of the 'bus, exclaimed gleefully,
"Look at 'em! Look at 'em!"</p>

<p>"Look at what?"</p>

<p>"At all the girls down our road, there," explained
Million, with a wave of her tightly gloved hand.</p>

<p>At almost every house in Laburnum Grove a maid,
in pink or lilac print, with pail and floor-cloth, was
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;21]</span>
giving the steps their matutinal wash. One was polishing
the knocker, the bell-handles, and the brass plate
of the doctor's abode.</p>

<p>"And here am I, as large as life, a-ridin' on a 'bus
the first thing in the morning!" enlarged Million,
clenching her fists and sitting bolt upright. "At half-past
nine o'clock, if you please&mdash;first time I've ever
done such a thing! I've often wondered what it was
like, top of a 'bus on a fine summer's morning! I'll
know now!"</p>

<p>"You won't ever have to know again," I laughed
as I sat there beside her. "You won't be going in any
more 'buses or trams or tubes."</p>

<p>"Why ever not, miss?" asked Million, startled.</p>

<p>"Why! Because you'll have your own car to go
about in directly, of course," I explained. "Probably
two or three cars&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Cars?" echoed Million, staring at me.</p>

<p>"Why, of course. Don't you see there's a new life
beginning for you now? A Rolls-Royce instead of a
motor-'bus, and everything on the same scale. You'll
have to think in sovereigns now, Million, where you've
always thought in pennies&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What? Three pounds for a thrupenny ride to the
Bank, d'you mean, miss?" cried Million, with a little
shriek. "Oh, my godfathers!"</p>

<p>At that excited little squeal of hers another passenger
on the 'bus had turned to glance at her across the
gangway.</p>

<p>I met his eyes; the clear, blue, boyish eyes of the
young man from next door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;22]</span>
He looked away again immediately. There was an
expression on his face that seemed meant to emphasise,
to underline, the announcement that he had never seen
me before. No. Apparently he had never set eyes on
the small, chestnut-haired girl (myself) in the shabby
blue serge coat and skirt and the straw hat that had
been white last summer, and that was now home-dyed&mdash;rather
unsuccessfully&mdash;to something that called itself
black. So evidently Aunt Anastasia had been rude to
him about yesterday evening. Possibly she had forbidden
him to speak to her niece and her dear brother's
child, and Lady Anastasia's great-granddaughter ever
again. This made my blood boil. Why must she make
us look so ridiculous? Such&mdash;such futile snobs? Without
any apparent excuse for keeping ourselves so aloof,
either! To put on "select" airs without any circumstances
to carry them off with is like walking about in
a motor-coat and goggles when you haven't got any
motor, when you never will have any motor! It's Million
who will have those.</p>

<p>Anyhow, I felt I didn't want him to think I was as
absurd as my aunt. I cleared my throat. I turned
towards him. In quite a determined sort of voice I
said "Good morning!"</p>

<p>Hereupon the young man from next door raised his
straw hat, and said "Good morning" in a polite but
distant tone.</p>

<p>He glanced at Million, then away again. In the blue
eye nearest to me I think I surprised a far-away
twinkle. How awful! Possibly he was thinking,
"H'm! So the dragon of an aunt doesn't let the girl
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;23]</span>
out now without a maid as a chaperon to protect her!
Is she afraid that somebody may elope with her at half-past
nine in the morning?"</p>

<p>I was sorry I'd spoken.</p>

<p>I looked hard away from the young man all the rest
of the ride to Chancery Lane.</p>

<p>Here we got off.</p>

<p>We walked half-way up the little busy, narrow thoroughfare,
and in at a big, cool, cave-like entrance to
some offices.</p>

<p>"Chesterton, Brown, Jones, and Robinson. Third
Floor," I read from the notice-board. "No lift. Come
along, Million."</p>

<p>The stars had faded out of Million's eyes again. She
looked scared. She clutched me by the arm.</p>

<p>"Oh, Miss Beatrice! I do hate goin' up!"</p>

<p>"Why, you little silly! This isn't the dentist's."</p>

<p>"I know. But, oh, miss! If there is one thing I
can't bear it's being made game of," said Million, pitifully,
half-way up the stairs. "This Mr. Chesterton&mdash;he
won't half laugh!"</p>

<p>"Why should he laugh?"</p>

<p>"At me, bein' supposed to have come in for all
those dollars of me uncle's. Do I look like an heiress?"</p>

<p>She didn't, bless her honest, self-conscious little
heart. From her brown hat, wreathed with forget-me-nots,
past the pin-on blue velvet tie, past the
brown cloth costume, down to the quite new shoes that
creaked a little, our Million looked the very type of
what she was&mdash;a nice little servant-girl taking a day
off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;24]</span>
But I laughed at her, encouraging her for all I was
worth, until we reached the third floor and the clerk's
outer office of Messrs. Chesterton, Brown, Jones, and
Robinson.</p>

<p>I knocked. Million drew a breath that made the
pin-on tie surge up and down upon the breast of her
Jap silk blouse. She was pulling herself together, I
knew, taking her courage in both hands.</p>

<p>The door was opened by a weedy-looking youth of
about eighteen.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Mr. Chesterton. Hope I'm not
late," Million greeted him in a sudden, loud, aggressive
voice that I had never heard from her before; the
voice of nervousness risen to panic. "I've come about
that money of mine from my uncle in&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Name, Miss, please?" said the weedy youth.</p>

<p>"Nellie Mary Million&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Miss Million," I amended. "We have an appointment
with Mr. Chesterton."</p>

<p>"Mr. Chesterton hasn't come yet," said the weedy
youth. "Kindly take a seat in here."</p>

<p>He went into the inner office. I sat down. Million,
far too nervous to sit down, wandered about the waiting-room.</p>

<p>"My, it doesn't half want cleaning in here," she remarked
in a flurried whisper, looking about her. "Why,
the boy hasn't even taken down yesterday's teacups. I
wonder how often they get a woman in. Look at those
cobwebs! A shaving-mirror&mdash;well, I never!" She
breathed on it, polishing it with her black moirette reticule.
"Some notice here about 'Courts,' Miss Beatrice.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;25]</span>
Don't it make you feel as if you was in the dock? I
wonder what they keep in this little corner-cupboard."</p>

<p>"The handcuffs, I expect. No, no, Million, you
mustn't look at them." Here the weedy youth put in
his head again.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_26" id="Pg_26">[Pg&nbsp;26]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>THE LAWYER'S DILEMMA</h3>

<p class="noindent">"<span class="smcap">Step</span> this way, please," he said. With an imploring
"You go first, Miss," from the heiress we "stepped"
into the inner office. It was a big, handsomely carpeted
room, with leather chairs. Around the walls were
shelves with black-japanned deed-boxes bearing white-lettered
names. I saw little Million's eyes fly to these
boxes. I know what she was wildly thinking&mdash;that one
must be hers and must contain the million dollars of
her new fortune. Beside the large cleared desk there
was standing a fatherly looking old gentleman. He
had white hair, a shrewd, humorous, clean-shaven face,
and gold-rimmed glasses. He turned, with a very pleasant
smile, to me.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Miss Million," he said. "I am
very glad to have the&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"This is Miss Million," I told him, putting my hand
on her brown sleeve and giving her arm a little, heartening
pat.</p>

<p>Million moistened her lips and drew another long
breath as the fatherly old gentleman turned the eyes
and their gold-rimmed glasses upon her small, diffident
self.</p>

<p>"Ah! M'm&mdash;really! Of course! How do you do,
Miss Million?"</p>

<p>"Nicely&mdash;nicely, thanks!" breathed Million huskily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;27]</span>
"Won't you sit down, ladies? Yes. Now, Miss
Million&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>And Mr. Chesterton began some sort of a congratulatory
speech, while Million smiled in a frightened sort
of way, breathing hard. She was full of surprises to
me that morning; and, I gathered, to her lawyer also.</p>

<p>"Thank you, I'm sure. Thank you, sir," she said.
Then suddenly to me, "We didn't ought to&mdash;to&mdash;to
keep this gentleman, did we, Miss?" Then to Mr.
Chesterton again, "D'you mind me asking, sir, if we
'adn't better have a cab?"</p>

<p>"A cab?" the lawyer repeated, in a startled tone.
"What for?"</p>

<p>"To take away the money, sir," explained little Million
gravely. "That money o' mine from me uncle.
What I've called about."</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;to take away&mdash;&mdash;" began the lawyer. Then
he suddenly laughed outright. I laughed. But together
we caught sight of little Million's face, blushing
and hurt, sensitive of ridicule. We stopped laughing
at once.</p>

<p>And then the old lawyer, looking and speaking as
kindly as possible, began to explain matters to this
ingenuous little heiress, as painstakingly as if he were
making things clear to a child.</p>

<p>"The capital of one million dollars, or of two hundred
thousand pounds of English money, is at present
not here; it is where it was&mdash;invested in the late Mr.
Samuel Million's sausage and ham-curing factory in
Chicago, U. S. A."</p>

<p>Here Million's face fell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;28]</span>
"Not here. Somehow, Miss," turning to me, "I
thought it never sounded as if it could be true. I
thought there'd be some kind of a 'have,' sort of!"</p>

<p>"And, subject to your approval always, I should be
inclined to allow that capital to remain where it is,"
continued the old lawyer in his polished accent. "There
remains, of course, the income from the capital. This
amounts, at present, to ten thousand pounds a year in
English money&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What is that," breathed the new heiress, "what
is that a quarter, sir? It seems more natural like that."</p>

<p>"Two thousand five hundred pounds, Miss Million."</p>

<p>"Lor'!" breathed the owner of this wealth. "And
me that's been getting five pounds a quarter. That
other's mine?"</p>

<p>"After a few necessary formalities, from which I
anticipate no difficulties," said the old gentleman.</p>

<p>Some discussion of these formalities followed. In the
midst of it I saw Million begin to fidget even more restlessly.</p>

<p>I frowned at her. This drew the attention of the
old gentleman upon me. Million was murmuring something
about, "Very sorry. Got to get back soon, Miss.
Lunch to lay&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Absurd Million! As if she would ever have to lay
lunch again as long as she lived! Couldn't she realise
the upheaval in her world? I gazed reproachfully at
her.</p>

<p>The lawyer said to me quite pleasantly: "May I ask
if you are a relation of Miss Million?"</p>

<p>Hereupon Miss Million shot at him a glance of outrage.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;29]</span>
"A relation? <span class="smcap">Her</span>?" she cried. "The
ideear!" Little Million's sense of "caste," fostered
at the Soldiers' Orphanage, is nearly as strong as my
Aunt Anastasia's. No matter if her secret day-dream
has always been "to marry a gentleman." She was
genuinely shocked that her old lawyer had not realised
the relations between her little hard-working self and
our family.</p>

<p>So she announced with simple dignity: "This is Miss
Lovelace, the young lady where I am in service."</p>

<p>"Were in service," I corrected her.</p>

<p>Million took me up sharply. "I haven't given notice,
Miss. I'm not leaving."</p>

<p>"But, you absurd Million, of course you are," I
said. "You can't go on living in Laburnum Grove
now. You're a rich man's heiress&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Will that stop me living where I want? I'm all
alone in the world," faltered Million, suddenly looking
small and forlorn as she sat there by the big desk.
"You're the only real friend I got in the world, Miss
Beatrice. I always liked you. You always talked to me
as if you was no more a young lady than what I was.
D'you think&mdash;&mdash;" Her voice shook. She seemed to
have forgotten the presence of old Mr. Chesterton.
"D'you think I'd a-stopped so long with your Aunt Nasturtium
if it hadn't been for not wantin' to leave where
you was? I'd be lost without you. I shouldn't know
where to put myself, Miss. Oh, Miss!" There was a
sob in her voice. "Don't say I got to go away from
you! What am I to do with myself and all that
money?" There was a perplexed silence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;30]</span>
Million's lawyer glanced at me over his gold-rimmed
glasses, and I glanced back above Million's forget-me-not-wreathed
hat.</p>

<p>It is a problem.</p>

<p>This little lonely, thrifty creature&mdash;brought up to
such a different idea of life&mdash;what is to be done about
her now?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>MILLION LEAVES HER PLACE</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Million</span> has gone!</p>

<p>She has left us, our little cheerful, and bonnie, and
capable maid-of-all-work who has become a millionaire
pork-butcher's heiress!</p>

<p>Never again will her trim, aproned figure busy itself
about our small and shockingly inconvenient kitchen
at No. 45. Never again will she have to struggle with
the vagaries of its range. Never again will she "do
out" our drawing-room with its disgraceful old carpet
and its graceful old cabinet. Never again will she quail
under the withering rebuke with which my Aunt Anastasia
was wont to greet her if she returned half a
minute late from her evening out. Never again will she
entertain me with her stream of artless comments on
life and love and her own ambition&mdash;"Oh, Miss, dear,
I should like to marry a gentleman!"</p>

<p>Well, I suppose there's every probability now that
this ambition may be gratified. Plenty of hard-up
young men about, even of the Lovelace class, "our"
class, who would be only too pleased to provide for
themselves by marrying a Million, in both senses of the
word.</p>

<p>Laburnum Grove, Putney, S.W., will know her no
more. And I, Beatrice Lovelace, who was born in
the same month of the same year as this other
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;32]</span>
more-favoured girl&mdash;I feel as if I'd lost my only
friend.</p>

<p>I also feel as if it were at least a couple of years
since it all happened. Yet it is only three days since
Million and I went down to Chancery Lane together
to interview the old lawyer person on the subject of
her new riches. I shall never forget that interview. I
shall never be able to forget the radiant little face of
Million at the end of it all, when the kind old gentleman
offered to advance her some of her own money "down
on the nail," and did advance her five pounds in cash&mdash;five
golden, gleaming, solid sovereigns!</p>

<p>"My godfathers!" breathed Million, as she tucked
the coins into the palm of her brown-thread glove.</p>

<p>She'd never had so much money at once before in
the whole course of her twenty-three years of life. (I've
<i>never</i> had it, of course!) And the tangible presence
of those heavy coins in her hand seemed to bring it
home to Million that she was rich, more than all the
explanations of her old lawyer about investments and
capital.</p>

<p>I saw him look, half-amusedly, half-anxiously, at the
little heiress's flushed face and the gesture with which
she clenched that fist full of gold. And it was then that
he began to urge upon us that "Miss Million" must
find some responsible older person or persons, some
ladies with whom she might live while she made her
plans respecting the rearrangement of her existence.</p>

<p>To cut a long story short, it was he, the old lawyer,
who suggested and arranged for "Miss Million's" next
step. It appears that he has sisters "of a reasonable
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;33]</span>
age" (I suppose that means about a hundred and
thirty-eight) who are on the committee of a hostelry
for gentlewomen of independent means, somewhere in
Kensington.</p>

<p>Sure to be a "pussery" of some sort! "Gentlewomen"
living together generally relapse into spitefulness
and feuds, and "means" can often be pronounced
"mean"!</p>

<p>Still, as Million's old lawyer said, the place would
provide a haven <i>pro tem</i>.</p>

<p>Our millionairess went off there this morning. She
wouldn't take a taxi.</p>

<p>"What's the use o' wasting all that fare from here
to Kensington, good gracious?" said Million. "There's
no hurry about me getting there long before lunch,
after all, Miss Beatrice. And as for me things, they
can come by Carter Paterson a bit later. I'll put the
card up now, if Miss Lovelace don't mind. There's
only that tin trunk that I've had ever since the Orphanage,
and me straw basket with the strap round&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Such luggage for an heiress! I couldn't help smiling
at it as it waited in the kitchen entrance. And
then the smile turned to a lump in my throat as Million,
in her hat and jacket, stumped down the wooden
back stairs to say good-bye to me.</p>

<p>"I said good-bye to your Aunt Nastur&mdash;to Miss
Lovelace, before she went out, Miss." (My aunt is
lunching at the hotel of one of her few remaining old
friends who is passing through London.)</p>

<p>"Can't say I shall breck my heart missin' her, Miss
Beatrice," announced the candid Million. "Why, at
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;34]</span>
the last she shook 'ands&mdash;hands as if I was all over
black-lead and she was afraid of it coming off on her!
But you&mdash;you've always been so different, as I say.
You always seemed to go on as if"&mdash;Million's funny
little voice quivered&mdash;"as if Gord had made us
both&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't, Million," I said chokily. "I shall cry if
you go on like this. And tears are so unlucky to
christen a new venture with."</p>

<p>"Is that what they say, Miss?" rejoined the superstitious
Million, winking back the fat, shiny drops that
were gathering in her own grey eyes. "Aw right, then,
I won't. 'Keep smiling,' eh? Always merry and
bright, and cetrer. Good-bye, Miss. Oh, lor'! I wish
you was coming along with me to this place, instead of
me going off alone to face all these strange females&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I wish I were; only I shall have to stay and keep
the house until my aunt comes back&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Drat 'er! I mean&mdash;&mdash;Excuse me, Miss Beatrice.
I wish you hadn't a-got to live with her. Thrown away
on her, you are. It's you that ought to be clearing out
of this place, not just me. You ought to have some
sort of a big bust-up and then bunk!"</p>

<p>"Where to, Million?"</p>

<p>"Anywheres! Couldn't you come where I was?
Anyways, Miss, will you drop me a line sometimes to
say how you're keeping? And, Miss, would you be offended
if I said good-bye sort of properly. I know it's
like my sorce, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Million, dear!" I cried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;35]</span>
I threw both my arms round her sturdy little jacketed
figure. We kissed as heartily as if we had been
twin sisters instead of ex-mistress and ex-maid.</p>

<p>Then Million&mdash;Miss Million, the heiress&mdash;trotted off
down Laburnum Grove towards the stopping-place of
the electric trams. And I, Beatrice Lovelace, the
pauper, the come-down-in-the-world, turned back into
No. 45, feeling as if what laughter there had been in
my life had gone out of it for ever!</p>

<p>I suppose I'd better have lunch&mdash;Million's laid it
ready for me for the last time!&mdash;then sit in the drawing-room,
finishing my darning, and waiting for my
aunt's return. If Million had been here I could have
spent the afternoon with her in the kitchen. Million
gone! I feel lost without her.</p>

<p>Nothing else will happen to-day.</p>

<p>There's a ring at the bell. How unlike Aunt Anastasia
to forget her key! I must go....</p>

<p>(Later.)</p>

<p>I went. But it was not Aunt Anastatia's herring-slim
figure that stood on the doorstep which Million
insisted on whitening for the last time this morning.
It was the tall, broad-shouldered, active and manly-looking
figure of the young man from next door.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_36" id="Pg_36">[Pg&nbsp;36]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>ANOTHER RUMPUS!</h3>

<p class="noindent">"<span class="smcap">Oh</span>!" I said&mdash;and felt myself blushing scarlet at
the memory of all the absurd little incidents that were
between me and this stranger. The incident of the
garden-hose, and of my giving him a shower-bath with
it the other evening; and how Aunt Anastasia had
poured added cold water over him in a metaphorical
manner of speaking. Then came the memory of how
we had met the next morning on the top of the 'bus
when I was chaperoning Million to her lawyer's. And
of how the young man, chastened by my aunt's best
iced manner the night before, wouldn't even have said
"Good morning" unless I had addressed him. It was
all very absurd, but confusing.</p>

<p>He said, in that pleasant voice of his: "Good afternoon!
I wish to return some property of yours."</p>

<p>"Of mine?" I said, puzzled. I wondered whether
a bit of lace of ours or something of that sort had
blown out of the window of No. 45 into the garden of
No. 44.</p>

<p>But the young man, putting his hand into his jacket
pocket, took out and held in the palm of his hand the
"property." It was an oval silver brooch, bearing in
raised letters the name "Nellie." The young man said,
"I noticed it on the top of the 'bus just after you got
off the other morning; you must have dropped it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;37]</span>
"Oh! Thank you so much," I began, taking the
brooch. "It isn't mine, as a matter of fact, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh," he said pleasantly, "you are not 'Nellie'?"</p>

<p>Then he hadn't heard Aunt Anastasia calling me in
that very rasping voice the other evening.</p>

<p>"No," I said, "'Nellie' is our maid; at least she was
our maid."</p>

<p>"Oh, really?" he said, very interested.</p>

<p>He has a delightful face. I don't wonder Million said
he was just what she meant by "the sort of young gentleman"
that she would like to marry.</p>

<p>Then a thought struck me.</p>

<p>Why not?</p>

<p>Men have married their pretty cooks before now.
Why shouldn't this nice young man be Million's fate?
He certainly did seem interested in her. It would be a
regular King-Cophetua-and-the-Beggar-Maid romance.
Only, owing to her riches, it would be Million's rôle to
play Queen Cophetua to this young man, who was too
poor to go into the Army. So, feeling quite thrilled
by the prospect of looking on at this love story, I said:
"Would you like to send the brooch on to&mdash;to&mdash;er&mdash;to
Miss Nellie Million yourself?" You see, I thought if he
knew where to take it, he would probably go at once to
the Hostelry for Cats of Independent Means and see
Million, and find out about her being now a young lady
of leisure&mdash;and&mdash;well, that might be the beginning of
things!</p>

<p>So I smiled at him and added in my most friendly
voice, "Would you like me to give you the address?"</p>

<p>It was at this moment&mdash;this precise moment before
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;38]</span>
he'd even had time to answer&mdash;that Aunt Anastasia,
back from her visit to her friend, came up the tiny
garden path behind him.</p>

<p>Yes, and this was the scene that met her gaze: her
niece, her poor brother's child, Lady Anastasia's great-granddaughter
(who had already been reproved for forgetting
that she belonged to "<span class="smcap">our family</span>"), standing
at the front door of her abode to repeat the offence
for which she had been taken to task&mdash;namely, "talking
to one of the impossible people who live about
here!" The way in which Aunt Anastasia stalked past
the young man was more withering than the most annihilating
glance she could have given him.</p>

<p>To me she said, in a voice that matched her look:
"Beatrice, come into the house."</p>

<p>I went into the drawing-room.</p>

<p>She followed me.</p>

<p>Then the storm broke!</p>

<p>Of all the many "rows" I've had since I came to
live with Aunt Anastasia, this did, as Million would
have said, "take the bun."</p>

<p>"Beatrice!" She threw my name at me as if it
had been a glove thrown in my face. "Beatrice!
Little cause as I have to think well of you, I did at
least trust you!"</p>

<p>"You've no reason, Auntie," said I, holding myself
as stiff as she did (which was pretty ramroddy).
"You've no reason not to trust me."</p>

<p>"What?" A bitter little laugh. "No sooner is
my back turned, no sooner have I left you alone in
the house, than you betray my confidence. How do
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;39]</span>
I find you, after all that I said to you only the other
evening on this same subject? Standing there on the
doorstep, just as if you'd been poor Million, poor little
gutter-bred upstart, preparing to receive&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I wasn't 'preparing to receive' anybody!" hotly
from me.</p>

<p>"No?" with icy satire from Aunt Anastasia.
"You were not even going to ask the young man in?
You stood there, like a scullery-maid indulging in a
vulgar flirtation with a policeman."</p>

<p>"I wasn't, I wasn't."</p>

<p>"I heard you giving him an address where he could
write to you, doubtless?"</p>

<p>"Write to me? It was nothing of the kind," I took
up, ready to stamp with rage. "It was&mdash;it was Million's
address I was going to give to that young man."</p>

<p>"A likely story! Million, indeed!"</p>

<p>"You don't believe me? How dare you not, Aunt
Anastasia? Look! Here's the proof!" And I held
out to her the oval silver brooch with the raised "Nellie"
upon it.</p>

<p>"Look! This is Million's brooch. She dropped it
on the 'bus the other morning. And the young man
from next door found it. And he came round to return
it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes. As soon as he had made certain, or had
been assured, that you would be alone," declared my
Aunt Anastasia, with unyielding accusation in every
angle of her. "To return Million's brooch! Oh, Beatrice,
you must think me very unsophisticated!" The
thin lips curled. "This is an excuse even thinner than
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;40]</span>
that about the garden-hose the other evening. No doubt
there have been others. How long have you been carrying
on this underhand and odious flirtation with that
unspeakable young cad?"</p>

<p>"Auntie!" I felt myself shaking all over with justifiable
indignation. A flirtation? I? With that young
man! Why, why&mdash;when I'd such honourable intentions
of securing him, as her "gentleman" lover, for our
newly made heiress, Million! I simply boiled over with
righteous rage. I said, "You've no right to make such
a suggestion."</p>

<p>"Beatrice! You forget to whom you are speaking."</p>

<p>"I don't. But I'm twenty-three, and I don't think
you need go on treating me as if I were a schoolgirl,
refusing to listen to what I have to say. Allowing me
no liberty, no friends&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Friends! Is that why you make your own in this
hole-and-corner fashion?"</p>

<p>"I shouldn't be to blame if I did!" I declared hotly.
"You don't realise what my life is here with you. It's
all very well for you to live in the past, pondering over
the dear departed glories of our family. But at my
age one doesn't care twopence for an illustrious past.
What one wants is something to do, and to be&mdash;and to
enjoy&mdash;in the present! I don't see why it should be
enough for me to remember that, even if I am poor, I
am still Lady Anastasia's great-granddaughter. It
isn't enough! It's the most futile sort of existence in
the whole world&mdash;living up to an old pedigree when
you haven't even got money enough to buy yourself
the right kind of shoes. You sneer at Million for being
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;41]</span>
what you call nouveau-riche. It isn't half as humiliating
and ridiculous as being what we are&mdash;nouveau-pauvre!"</p>

<p>"Beatrice, I think you have gone mad, to say such
things."</p>

<p>"Do you? I haven't. I've been thinking them inside
me for months&mdash;years," I told her violently. The
oval mirror on the opposite side of the wall from that
Gainsborough portrait of Lady Anastasia showed a
queer picture; the picture of a tall, angular, grey-haired
and aristocratic-looking spinster in steel-grey
alpaca, coldly facing a small, rumpled-looking girl
(myself) with the tense pose, the bright flush, and the
clenched hands of anger. "And now I can't&mdash;I can't
stand this sort of thing any longer&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"May I ask what you intend to do?"</p>

<p>"To go!" I had only that instant thought of it.
But once the words were out of my mouth I realised
that it was the only thing in the world to do. Hadn't
Million said so only this morning when she bade me
good-bye? "You ought to clear out of this house....
You ought to have a fair old bust-up, Miss Beatrice.
And then you ought to bunk!"</p>

<p>Well! "The fair old bust-up" I'd had, or was having.
The next thing was "to bunk"!</p>

<p>Aunt Anastasia regarded me with cold eyes and a
still more contemptuous curl of the lip.</p>

<p>"You will go, Beatrice? But how? To what?"</p>

<p>"To earn my own living&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What? There is nothing that you can do."</p>

<p>"I know," I admitted resentfully. "That's another
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;42]</span>
grudge I have against our family. They never have
had to 'come down into the market-place.' Consequently
they wouldn't adapt themselves to the new conditions
and fit themselves for the market now. They'd
rather stand aside and vegetate in a mental backwater
on twopence a year, thinking, 'We are still Lovelaces,'
and learning nothing, nothing. Talk about 'The Idle
Rich'! They are not such cucumbers of the ground as
'The Idle Poor'! I've been trained to nothing. Lots
of the girls who live along this road have taken up
typewriting, or County Council cookery, or teaching&mdash;things
that will give them independence. I have nothing
of the sort to fall back upon. I might take care
of little children, perhaps, but people like Norland
nurses at a hundred a year nowadays. Or I might find
a post as a lady's maid&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Well, you taught me to pack and to mend lace,
Auntie! And I can do hair&mdash;it's the only natural gift
I've got," I said. "Perhaps I might get them to give
me a chance in some small hairdresser's to begin with."</p>

<p>"You are talking nonsense, and you do not even
mean what you say, child."</p>

<p>"I mean every word of it, and I don't see why it
should be nonsense," I persisted. "It isn't, when these
other girls talk of making a career for themselves somehow.
They can get on&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They are not ladies."</p>

<p>"It's a deadly handicap being what our family calls
a lady," said I. "I'm going to stop being one and to
have something like a life of my own at last."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;43]</span>
"I forbid you," said Aunt Anastasia, in her stoniest
voice, "I forbid you to do anything that is unbefitting
my niece, my brother's child, and Lady Anastasia's
great-granddaughter!"</p>

<p>"Auntie, I am past twenty-one," I said quite quietly.
"No one can 'forbid' my doing anything that is within
the law! And I'm going to take the rest of my life
into my own hands."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>MY DEPARTURE</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">I have</span> been putting on all my outdoor things.</p>

<p>For I feel desperate.</p>

<p>And I must take advantage of this feeling. If I
wait until to-morrow, when my rage and indignation
and violent dissatisfaction with things-as-they-are have
died down, and I'm normal again, well, then I shall get
nothing done. I shall think: "Perhaps life here with
Aunt Anastasia at No. 45 Laburnum Grove, isn't so
bad after all, even if I do never have any parties or
young friends or pretty frocks or anything that other
happier, less-aristocratically connected girls look upon
as a matter of course. Anyhow, there's nothing for it
but to go on in the same humdrum fashion that I've been
doing&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Ah, no! I mustn't let myself go back to thinking
like that again.</p>

<p>The secret of success is to get something done while
you're in the mood for it!</p>

<hr />

<p>In our hall with the unmended umbrella stand and
the trophy of Afghan knives I was stopped by Aunt
Anastasia.</p>

<p>"At least I insist upon knowing," she said, "where
you are going now?"</p>

<p>I said, quite gently and amiably: "I am going to see
Million."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;45]</span>
"Million? The little object who was the servant
here? Your taste in associates becomes more and more
deplorable, Beatrice. You should not forget that even if
she has happened to come into money"&mdash;my aunt spoke
the very word as who should say "Dross!"&mdash;and concluded:
"She is scarcely a person of whom you can
make a friend."</p>

<p>"Million has always been a very staunch little friend
of mine ever since she came here," I said, not without
heat. "But I am going to this hostel of hers to
ask her about something that has nothing to do with
'friendship.' You have her address. You know that
it's a deadly respectable place. I expect I shall stay
the night there, Aunt Anastasia. Good-bye." And off
I went.</p>

<p>I was full of my new plan&mdash;a plan that seemed to
have flashed full-blown into my brain while I was putting
on my boots.</p>

<p>It had made me almost breathless with excitement
and anticipation by the time I had rung the bell of
the massive, maroon-painted door of the Kensington
address and had said to the bored-looking man-servant
who opened it: "May I see Miss Million, please?"</p>

<p>Such a plan it was as I had to unfold to her!</p>

<p>There was something odd and unfamiliar about the
appearance of Million when she ran in to greet me in
her new setting&mdash;the very Early Victorian, plushy,
marble-mantelpieced, glass-cased drawing-room of the
Ladies' Hostelry in Kensington.</p>

<p>What was the unfamiliar note? She wore her Sunday
blouse of white Jap silk; her brown cloth skirt that
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;46]</span>
dipped a little at the back. But what was it that made
her look so strange? Ah! I knew. It was so funny to
see our late maid-of-all-work in the house without a
cap on!</p>

<p>This incongruous thought dashed through my mind
as quickly as Million herself dashed over the crimson
carpet towards me.</p>

<p>"Miss Beatrice! Lor'! Doesn't it seem ages since I
seen you, and yet it's only this very morning since I left
your aunt's. Well, this is a treat," she cried, holding
out both of her little work-roughened hands. "It is
nice, seein' some one you know, after the lot of old cats,
and sketches, and freaks, and frosty-faces that live in
this establishment!"</p>

<p>And the new heiress gave herself a little shake as
she glanced round the spacious, gloomy apartment that
we had for the moment to ourselves. Evidently Million
found the Kensington "haven" recommended by her
lawyer no change for the better from our Putney villa.
Under the circumstances, and because of my plan, I
felt rather glad of this.</p>

<p>I said: "Don't you like the place, then, Million?
What are the people like?"</p>

<p>"Only one word to describe 'em, Miss Beatrice.
Chronic. Fair give you ther hump. None of 'em married,
except one, who's a colonel's widow, and thinks
she's everybody, and all of 'em about eighty-in-the-shade.
And spiteful! And nosey!" enlarged Million,
as we sat down together on one of the massive red-plush
covered sofas, under a large steel engraving of "Lord
Byron and the Maid of Athens." She went on: "They
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;47]</span>
wanted to know all about me, o' course. Watchin' me
every bite I put into my mouth at table, and me so
nervous that no wonder I helped myself to peas into
me glass of water! Lookin' down their noses at me and
mumbling to each other about me&mdash;not what I call very
polite manners&mdash;and chance the ducks! I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here the drawing-room door opened to admit one of
the ladies, I suppose, of whom Million had been complaining.
She wore a grey woolly shoulder-shawl and
myrtle-green hair&mdash;I suppose something had gone
wrong with the brown hair-restorer. And this lady
gave one piercing glance at me and another at Million
as she sidled towards a writing-table at the further end
of the drawing-room and sat down with her back
towards us. I'm sorry to say that Million twisted her
small face into a perfectly horrible grimace and stuck
out her tongue at the back. Then she, Million, lowered
her voice as she chattered on about her new surroundings.</p>

<p>"Cry myself to sleep every night, I should, if I was
to try to stay on here," she said. "Couldn't feel happy
here, not if it was ever so! Oh, I'd rather go back to
the Orphanage. Something of me own 'age' there, anyhow!
Don't care if it is very tony and high-class and
recommended. It's not my style.... I don't know
where I'm going after, but, Miss Beatrice, I'm going
to get out of this! I can't stay in a place that makes
me feel as if I was in prison, so I'm going to hop it."</p>

<p>"That's just how I felt, Million. That's what I
made up my mind to do," I told her. The new heiress
gazed at me with all her bright grey eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;48]</span>
"What? You, Miss Beatrice? You don't mean&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That I'm not going on living at No. 45 Laburnum
Grove!"</p>

<p>"What?" Million raised her voice incautiously, and
the myrtle-green-haired lady glanced around. "Miss
Nosey Parker," muttered Million, and then "Straight?
You mean you've had a bust-up with your Aunt Nasturtium?"</p>

<p>"Rather," I nodded.</p>

<p>"About that young gentleman, I lay?" said Million.
"Him from next door."</p>

<p>"How did you guess it was that? It was," I admitted.
"He came to return this brooch of yours that
you dropped on the 'bus&mdash;here it is&mdash;and my aunt
chose to&mdash;to&mdash;to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I know the way Miss Lovelace would 'choose',"
said Million, with gusto. "So you left her, Miss Beatrice!
So you done a flit at last, like I always been
saying you did ought to do! You done it! Cheers!
And now what are you thinking to do? Coming to me,
are you?"</p>

<p>I smiled into the little affectionate rosy face that I
was so accustomed to seeing under a white frilly cap
with a black bow.</p>

<p>I said: "Yes, Million. I'm coming to you if you'll
have me."</p>

<p>"Ow! That's the style, Miss&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If I come, you won't have to call me 'Miss' any
more," I said firmly. "That'll be part of it."</p>

<p>"Part of what?" asked Million, bewildered.</p>

<p>"Part of the arrangement I want to make with you,"
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;49]</span>
I said. And then, looking up, I beheld curiosity written
in every line of the back of that woman at the writing-table.
I said: "Million, I can't talk to you here.
Get your hat on and come out. We'll discuss this in
the Park."</p>

<p>And in the Park, sitting side by side on two green
wooden chairs, I unfolded to Million my suddenly conceived
plan.</p>

<p>"Now, listen," I began. "You're a rich girl&mdash;a
young woman with a big fortune of her own&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Miss, I don't seem to realise it one bit,
yet&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You'll have to realise it. You'll have to begin and
adapt yourself to it all, quite soon. And the sooner
you begin the sooner you'll feel at home in it all."</p>

<p>"I don't feel as if I'd got a home, now," said Million,
with the forlorn look coming over her face. "I don't
feel as if I should ever make anything out of it&mdash;of this
here being an heiress, I mean."</p>

<p>"Million, you'll have to 'make something of it'.
Other people do. People who haven't been brought
up to riches. It may not 'come natural' to them, at
first. But they learn. They learn to live as if they'd
always been accustomed to beautiful clothes, and to having
houses, and cars, and all that sort of thing, galore.
Million, these are the things you've got to acquire now
you're rich," I said quite threateningly. "Even your
dear old lawyer knew that this Kensington place was
only '<i>pro tem</i>'. You'll have to have an establishment,
to settle where you'll live, and what you want to do
with yourself."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;50]</span>
"I don't want to do nothing, Miss Beatrice," said
little Million helplessly.</p>

<p>"Don't talk nonsense. You know you told me yourself
quite lately," I reminded her, "that you had one
great wish."</p>

<p>Million's troubled little face lifted for a moment into
a smile, but she shook her head (in that awful crimsony
straw hat that she will wear "for best").</p>

<p>"You do remember that wish," I said. "You told
me that you would so like to marry a gentleman. Well,
now, here you will have every chance of meeting and
marrying one!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Miss! But I'm reely&mdash;reely not the kind of
girl that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So you'll have to set to and make yourself into
the kind of girl that the kind of 'gentleman' you'd
like would be wild to marry. You'll have to&mdash;&mdash;Well,
to begin with," I said impressively, "you'll have to
get a very good maid."</p>

<p>"Do you mean a girl to do the work about the house,
Miss?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't. You'll have a whole staff of people to
do that for you," I explained patiently. "I mean a
personal maid, a lady's-maid. A person to do your
hair and to marcel-wave, and to manicure, and to massage
you! A person to take care of your beautiful
clo&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Haven't got any beautiful clothes, Miss."</p>

<p>"You will have. Your maid will take care of that,"
I assured her. "She'll go with you to all the best shops
and tell you what to buy. She'll see that you choose
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;51]</span>
the right colours," I said, with a baleful glance at the
crimson floppy hat disfiguring Million's little dark head.
"She'll tell you how your things are to be made. She'll
take care that you look like any other young lady with
a good deal of money to spend, and some taste to spend
it with. You don't want to look odd, Million, do you,
or to make ridiculous mistakes when you go about to
places where you'd meet&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Miss," said Million, blenching, "you know that
if there is one thing I can't stick it's havin' to think
people may be making game of me!"</p>

<p>"Well, the good maid would save you from that."</p>

<p>"I'd be afraid of her, then," protested Million.</p>

<p>I said: "No, you wouldn't. You've never been afraid
of me."</p>

<p>"Ah," said Million, "but that's different. You
aren't a lady's-maid&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>I said firmly a thing that made Million's jaw drop
and her eyes nearly pop out of her head. I said: "I
want to be a lady's-maid. I want to come to you as
your maid&mdash;Miss Million's maid."</p>

<p>"Miss Bee&mdash;atrice! You're laughing."</p>

<p>"I'm perfectly serious," I said. "Here I am; I've
left home, and I want to earn my own living. This is
the only way I can do it. I can pack. I can mend. I
can do hair. I have got 'The Sense of Clothes'&mdash;that
is, I should have," I amended, glancing down at my own
perfectly awful serge skirt, "if I had the chance of
associating with anything worthy of the name of
'clothes.' And I know enough about people to help you
in other ways. Million, I should be well worth the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;52]</span>
fifty or sixty pounds a year you'd pay me as
wages."</p>

<p>"Me pay you wages?" little Million almost shrieked.
"D'you mean it, Miss Beatrice?"</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"You mean for you, a young lady that's belonged
to the highest gentry, with titles and what not, to
come and work as lady's-maid to me, what's been maid-of-all-work
at twenty-two pounds a year in your aunt's
house?"</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"But, Miss&mdash;&mdash; It's so&mdash;so&mdash;Skew-wiff; too topsy-turvy,
somehow, I mean," protested Million, the soldier's
orphan, in tones of outrage.</p>

<p>I said: "Life's topsy-turvy. One class goes up in
the world (that's your millionaire uncle and you, my
dear), while another goes down (that's me and my aunts
and uncles who used to have Lovelace Court). Won't
you even give me a helping hand, Million? Won't you
let me take this 'situation' that would be such a good
way out of things for both of us? Aren't you going to
engage me as your maid, Miss Million?"</p>

<p>And I waited really anxiously for her decision.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_53" id="Pg_53">[Pg&nbsp;53]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>I BECOME MILLION'S MAID</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> impossible has happened.</p>

<p>I am "Miss Million's maid."</p>

<p>I was taken on&mdash;or engaged, or whatever the right
term is&mdash;a week ago yesterday.</p>

<p>I've surmounted all objections; the chief being Million&mdash;I
mean "Miss Million"&mdash;herself. Her I have
practically bullied into letting her ex-mistress come and
work for her. After much talk and many protests, I
said, finally, "Million, you've got to."</p>

<p>And Million finally said: "Very well, Miss Beatrice,
if you will 'ave it so, 'ave it so you will. It don't seem
right to me, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then there was my Aunt Anastasia, the controller
of my destiny up to now. Her I wrote to from that
hostelry in Kensington, which was Million's first
"move" from No. 45, the Putney villa. And from
Aunt Anastasia I received a letter of many sheets in
length.</p>

<p>Here are a few of the more plum-like extracts:</p>

<p class="blockquot1">"When I received the communication of your insane
plan, Beatrice, I was forced to retire to the privacy of
my own apartment"&mdash;</p>

<p>(Not so very "private," when the walls are so thin
that she can hear the girls in the adjoining room at
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;54]</span>
No. 46 rustling the tissue-paper of the box under the
bed that they keep their nicest hats in!)</p>

<p class="blockquot0">"and to take no fewer than five aspirins before I was
able to review the situation with any measure of calm."</p>

<p>Then&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot1">"It is well that my poor brother, your father, is not
here to see to what depths his only child has descended,
and to what a milieu!"</p>

<p>(The "descent" being from that potty little row
of packing-cases in Putney to the Hotel Cecil, where
I am engaging a suite of rooms for Miss Million and
her maid to-morrow!)</p>

<p class="blockquot1">"Your dear great-grandmother, Lady Anastasia,
would turn in her grave, did she ever dream that a Miss
Lovelace, a descendant of the Lovelaces of Lovelace
Court," etc., etc.</p>

<p>(But I am not a Lovelace now. I have told Million&mdash;I
mean, I have requested my new employer&mdash;to call me
"Smith." Nice, good, old, useful-sounding sort of
name. And more appropriate to my present station!)</p>

<p>Then my aunt writes:</p>

<p class="blockquot1">"Your fondness for associating with young men of
the bounder class over garden walls and on doorsteps
was already a sufficiently severe shock to me. As that
particular young man appears to be still about here,
poisoning the air of the garden with his tobacco smoke
and obviously gazing through the trellis in search of
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;55]</span>
you each evening, I suppose I must acquit him of any
complicity in your actions."</p>

<p>(I suppose that nice-looking young man at No. 44
has been wondering when I was going to finish giving
him Million's address to return that brooch.)</p>

<p>There's miles more of Auntie's letter. It ends up
with a majestically tearful supplication to me to return
to my own kith and kin (meaning herself and the
Gainsborough portrait!) and to remember who I am.</p>

<p>Nothing will induce me to do so! I've felt another
creature since I left No. 45, with the bamboo furniture
and the heirlooms. And, oh, what fun I'm going
to have over forgetting who I was. Hurray for the
new life of liberty and fresh experiences as Miss Million's
maid!</p>

<p>The first thing to do, of course, is to provide ourselves
with means to go about, to shop, to arrange
the preliminaries of our adventure! That five pounds
which Mr. Chesterton advanced to his new client
(smiling as he did so) will not do more than pay our
bill at the Home for Independent Cats, as Million calls
this Kensington place.</p>

<p>Mr. Chesterton not only smiled, he laughed outright
when we presented ourselves at the Chancery Lane office
together once more. I was again spokeswoman and
I came to the point at once.</p>

<p>"We want some more money, please."</p>

<p>"Not an uncommon complaint," said the old lawyer.
"But, pardon me, I have no money of yours! You
mean Miss Million wants some more money?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;56]</span>
I hope he doesn't think I'm a parasite of a girl who
clings on to little Million because she's happened to inherit
a fortune. Rather angrily I said: "We both want
it; because until Miss Million has some more she cannot
pay me my salary!"</p>

<p>He looked a little amazed at this, but he did not say
anything about his surprise that I was in a salaried
capacity to my little friend. He only said: "Well!
How much do you&mdash;and Miss Million&mdash;want? Five
pounds again? Five hundred&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, not five hundred all at once," gasped the awe-struck
Million; "I'd never feel I could go to sleep
with it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>While I cut in abruptly: "Yes, five hundred will do
for us to arrange ourselves on."</p>

<p>Thereupon the old lawyer made the suggestion that
was to be fraught with such odd consequences.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't it be more convenient," he said, "if an
account could be opened in Miss Million's name at a
bank?"</p>

<p>"That will do," said Miss Million's maid (myself),
while Miss Million gazed round upon the black dispatch-boxes
of the office.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later, with a cheque for £500 clutched
tightly in Miss Million's hand, also a letter from Mr.
Chesterton to Mr. Reginald Brace, the manager, we
found ourselves at the bank near Ludgate Circus that
Mr. Chesterton had recommended.</p>

<p>Million was once more doddering with nervousness.
Once more Miss Million's new maid had to take it all
upon herself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;57]</span>
"Mr. Brace," I demanded boldly over the shoulder
of an errand-lad who was handing in slips of paper
with small red stamps upon them.</p>

<p>One moment later and we were ushered into the manager's
private room.</p>

<p>Yet another second, and that room seemed echoing
with Million's gleeful shriek of "Why! Miss Beatrice!
See who it is? If it isn't the gent from next door!"</p>

<p>She meant the manager.</p>

<p>I looked up and faced the astonished blue eyes in
his nice sunburnt face.</p>

<p>Yes! It was the young man from No. 44 Laburnum
Grove; "the insufferable young bounder" on whose account
I had got into those "rows" with Aunt Anastasia.
So this was Mr. Reginald Brace, the bank manager!
This was where he took the silk hat I'd
seen disappearing down the grove each morning at
9.30.</p>

<p>He recognised us. All three of us laughed! He was
the first to be grave. Indeed, he was suddenly alarmingly
formal and ceremonious as he asked us to sit
down and opened Mr. Chesterton's letter.</p>

<p>I couldn't help watching his face as he read it, to
enjoy the look of blank amazement that I thought would
appear there when he found that the little maid-servant
he had noticed at the kitchen window of the next-door
villa to his own should be the young lady about whom
he had received this lawyer's letter.</p>

<p>No look of amazement appeared. You might just as
well have expected a marble mantelpiece to look surprised
that the chimney was smoking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;58]</span>
He said presently: "I shall be delighted to do as Mr.
Chesterton asks."</p>

<p>Then came a lot of business with the introduction
of the chief cashier, with a pass-book, a paying-in-book,
a cheque-book, and a big book for Million's name
and address (which she gave care of Josiah Chesterton,
Esq.). Then, when the cashier man had gone out
again, Mr. Brace's marble-mantelpiece manner vanished
also. He smiled in a way that seemed to admit
that he did remember there were such things as garden-hoses
and infuriated aunts in the world. But he didn't
seem to remember that it was not my business, but Million's,
that had brought us there. For it was to me that
he turned as he said in that pleasant voice of his: "Well!
This does seem rather a long way round to a short way
home, doesn't it?"</p>

<p>At that there came into my mind again the plan I
had for Million's benefit. Million should have her wish.
She should marry "the sort of young gentleman she'd
always thought of." I would bring these two together&mdash;the
good-looking, young, pleasant-voiced bank manager
and the little shy heiress, who would be extremely
pretty and attractive by the time I'd been her maid for
a month.</p>

<p>So I said: "You know, Miss Million's 'home' is no
longer at No. 45 in your road."</p>

<p>He said: "She seems to have some very good friends
there, though."</p>

<p>Here the artless Million broke in: "Not me, sir! I
never could bear that aunt of hers," with a nod at me,
"and no more couldn't Miss Beatrice, after I left!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;59]</span>
I tried to nudge Million, but could scarcely do so
just under that young man's interested blue eye. He
looked up quickly to me. "Then you have left?"</p>

<p>I smiled and nodded vaguely, and we sat for a moment
in silence, the tall, morning-coated young manager,
and the two girls still so shabbily dressed, that
you wouldn't have dreamt of connecting either of us
with millions. I wasn't going to let him into the situation
of mistress and maid just then. But I condescended
to inform him: "Miss Million will be at the
Hotel Cecil after to-morrow."</p>

<p>He flashed me one brief, blue glance. I wondered
if he guessed I'd a plan in my mind. Anyhow, he fell
in with it. For, as he shook hands for good-bye with
both of us, he said to Million: "Will you allow me to
call on you there?"</p>

<p>Million, looking overjoyed but flustered, turned to
me. Evidently I was to answer again.</p>

<p>I said sedately: "I am sure Miss Million will be glad
to let you call."</p>

<p>"When?" said the young bank manager rather
peremptorily.</p>

<p>I made a rapid mental calculation. I ought to be
able to get Million suitably clad for receiving admirers-to-be
in about&mdash;yes, four days.</p>

<p>I said: "On Thursday afternoon, at about five, if that
suits you."</p>

<p>"Admirably," said the young man whom I have selected
to marry Million. "Au revoir!"</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_60" id="Pg_60">[Pg&nbsp;60]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>WE MOVE INTO NEW QUARTERS</h3>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">The Hotel Cecil</span>, June, 1914.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I've</span> taken the first step towards setting up my new
employer, Miss Million, as a young lady of fortune.</p>

<p>That first step was&mdash;new luggage!</p>

<p>New clothes we could do without for a little longer
(though not for much longer. I'm quite firm about
that).</p>

<p>But new, expensive-looking trunks Miss Million must
have. It would be absolutely impossible for "Miss Million
and Maid" to make their appearance at a big
London hotel with the baggage which had witnessed their
exit from the Putney villa. My brown canvas hold-all
and her tin trunk with the rope about it&mdash;what did they
make us look like? Irish emigrants!</p>

<p>"Nice luggage is the mark of a lady," was one of my
Aunt Anastasia's many maxims.</p>

<p>So we spent the morning in Bond Street, buying
recklessly and wildly at Vuitton's and at that place
where you get the "Innovation" trunks that look like
a glorified wardrobe&mdash;all hangers and drawers. I did
all the ordering. Million stood by and looked like a
scared kitten. When the time came she signed the
cheques and gasped, "Lor', Miss!"</p>

<p>"Million, you're not to say 'Lor''," I ordered her
in a stage whisper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;61]</span>
I turned away from the polished shop assistants
who, I should think, must have had the morning of
their lives. I wonder what they made of their customers,
the two young women (one with a strong Cockney
accent) who dressed as if from a country rectory
jumble sale and who purchased trunks as if for a
duchess's trousseau?</p>

<p>"And you are not to say 'Miss.' Do remember,
Million," I urged her. "Now we'll have a taxi. Two
taxis, I mean."</p>

<p>One taxi was piled high with the new and princely
pile of "leather goods." Hat-boxes, dress-baskets, two
Innovation trunks, a week-end bag, and a dressing-case
with crystal and ivory fittings. The other taxi bore
off the small, "my-Sunday-out"-looking figure of
Miss Million and the equally small, almost equally badly
dressed figure of Miss Million's maid.</p>

<p>We drove first to the Kensington Hostelry and picked
up the old luggage. By the side of the new it looked not
even as respectable as an Irish emigrant's; it looked
like some Kentish hop-picker's! We made the driver unstrap
and open one of the large new dress-baskets. And
into this we dumped the hold-all and the tin trunk that
seemed to be labelled "My First Place." Then I ordered
him to drive to the Hotel Cecil, and off we whirled
again.</p>

<p>Our arrival at the Cecil was marked by quite a dramatic
little picture; like something on the stage, I
thought.</p>

<p>For as our taxi swept around the big circle of the
courtyard of the hotel, as it glided up exactly opposite
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;62]</span>
the middle door and a couple of gorgeously uniformed
commissionaires stepped forward, the air was
rent by the long, piercingly shrill notes of a posthorn.
There was the staccato clatter of horses' hoofs, and
there rattled and jingled up to the entrance a coach of
lemon-yellow-and-black, with four magnificent white
horses, driven by a very big and strongly built, ruddy-faced,
white-toothed young man, wearing a tall white
hat, a black-and-white check suit, yellow gloves, a hunting
tie with a black pearl pin in it, and one large red
rose.</p>

<p>This gay and startling apparition took our eyes and
our attention off everything else for a moment. Million's
grey eyes were indeed popping out of her head
like hat-pegs as the young man leapt lightly down from
the coach. She was staring undisguisedly at him. And
I saw him turn and give one very hard, straight glance&mdash;not
at Million&mdash;not at me. His eyes, which were
very blue and bright, were all for that taxi full of very
imposing-looking new luggage just behind us. Then
he turned to his friends on the coach; several other
young men, also dressed like Solomon in all his glory,
and a couple of ladies, very powdery, with cobalt-blue
eyelashes, and smothers of golden hair, and pretty
frocks that looked as if they'd got into them with the
shoehorn. (I don't think skirts can possibly get any
tighter than they are at this present moment of June,
1914, unless we take to wearing one on each leg.)</p>

<p>All these people were laughing and talking together
very loudly and calling out Christian names. "Jim!"
and "Sunny Jim!" seemed to be the big young man
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;63]</span>
who had driven them up. Then they all trooped off
towards the Palm Court, calling out something about
"Rattlesnake cocktails"&mdash;and Million and I came back
with a start to our own business.</p>

<p>A huge porter came along to take our luggage off
the cab. He put a tremendous amount of force into
hoisting one of the dress-baskets. It went up like a
feather. The empty one! I do wonder what he
thought....</p>

<p>We went into the Central Hall, crowded with people.
(Note.&mdash;I must teach Million to learn to walk in front
of me; she will sidle after me everywhere like a worm
that doesn't know how to turn.) We marched up to the
bureau. The man on the other side of the counter
pushed the big book towards me.</p>

<p>"Will you sign the register, please."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;no. I mean it isn't me." I drew back and
pinched my employer's arm. "You sign here, please,
Miss Million," I said very distinctly.</p>

<p>And Million, breathing hard and flushing crimson,
came forward, leant over the book, and slowly wrote in
her Soldiers' Orphanage copybook hand, with downstrokes
heavy and upstrokes light:</p>

<p>"Nellie Mary Million" (just as it had been written
on her insurance-card).</p>

<p>"Miss," I dictated in a whisper, "Miss Nellie Mary
Million and maid."</p>

<p>"'Ow, Miss, don't you write your name?" breathed
Million gustily. "Miss&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>I trod on her foot. I saw several American visitors
staring at us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;64]</span>
The man said: "Your rooms are forty-five, forty-six,
and forty-seven, Miss."</p>

<p>"Forty-five. Ow! Same number as at home," murmured
Million. "Will you please tell me how we get?"</p>

<p>It was one of the chocolate-liveried page-boys who
showed us to our rooms&mdash;the two large, luxuriously
furnished bedrooms and the sitting-room that seemed
so extraordinarily palatial to eyes still accustomed to
the proportions of No. 45 Laburnum Grove.</p>

<p>What a change! What other extraordinary changes
and contrasts lie before us, I wonder?</p>

<p>We were closely followed by the newly bought trunks;
one filled with ancient baggage, like a large and beautiful
nut showing a shrivelled kernel; the others an empty
magnificence. Million and I gazed upon them as they
stood among the white-painted hotel furniture, filling
the big room with the fragrance of costly leather.</p>

<p>Million said: "Well! I shall never get enough things
to fill all them, I don't s'pose."</p>

<p>"Won't you!" I said. "We go shopping again this
very afternoon; shopping clothes! And the question is
whether we've got enough boxes to hold them!"</p>

<p>"Miss!" breathed Million.</p>

<p>I turned from the tray, full of attractively arranged
little boxes and shelves, of the dress-basket. Quite
sharply I said: "How often am I to tell you not to call
me that?"</p>

<p>"Very sorry, Miss Beatrice. I mean&mdash;S&mdash;Smith!"
faltered Million. Her pretty grey eyes were full of
tears. Her small, bonnie face looked suddenly pinched
and pale. She sat down with a dump on the edge of the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;65]</span>
big brass bedstead. Very forlorn, she looked, the little
heiress.</p>

<p>"Sorry I was cross," I said penitently, patting my
employer's hand.</p>

<p>"It's not that, Miss," said Million, relapsing again,
"it's only&mdash;oh, haven't you got a sinkin'? I feel fair
famished, I do; indeed, what with all the going about,
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm awfully hungry, too," I admitted. "We'll go
down to the dining-room at once. Come along. You
go first. You are to!"</p>

<p>"Not to the dining-room here," objected Million, terrified.
"Not in this grand place, with all these people.
Oh, Miss, did you notice that young gentleman, him
with the red rose, and all the ladies in their lovely
dresses? I'd far rather just nip out and get a portion
of steak-and-kidney pie and a nice cupper tea at an
A.B.C. There is bound to be one close by here&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, we aren't going to it," I decreed firmly.
"Ladies with private incomes of a hundred and fifty
pounds a week don't lunch at marble-topped tables.
Anyhow, their maids won't. But if you don't want to
have luncheon here the first day, perhaps&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't; oh, not me. I couldn't get anything down,
I know I couldn't, and all these people dressed up so
grand, looking at me! (Did you see her with the cerise
feather in her hat that the young gentleman called
'facie'?) Oh, lor'!" The grey eyes filled again.</p>

<p>So I made a compromise and said we would lunch
out somewhere else; a good restaurant was near, where
you do at least get a table-cloth. In the hall we saw
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;66]</span>
again the young man who had driven up in the four-in-hand.
He was talking to one of the porters, and his
broad, black-and-white check back was towards us. I
heard what he was saying, in a deep voice with a soft
burr of Irish brogue in it&mdash;</p>

<p>"&mdash;with all those lashins of new trunks?... Million?...
Will she have anything to do with the Chicago
Million, the Sausage King, as they call him?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, sir," said the porter.</p>

<p>"Find out for me, will you?" said the four-in-hand
young man.</p>

<p>Then he turned round and saw me (again followed
by my sidling employer) making my way towards the
entrance.</p>

<p>He raised his hat in a rather empresse manner as he
allowed us to pass.</p>

<p>"Oh, Miss&mdash;I mean, oh, Smith! Isn't he handsome?"
breathed Million as we got out into the Strand.
"Did you notice what a lovely smile he'd got?"</p>

<p>I said rather chillingly: "I didn't very much like the
look of him."</p>

<p>And I'm going to try and stop Million from liking
the look of that sort of young man. Fortune-hunters,
beware!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>AN ORGY OF SHOPPING!</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Oh</span>, what an afternoon we've had!</p>

<p>Talk about "one crowded hour of glorious life."
Well, Million and I have had from two to six; that
is, four crowded glorious hours of shopping! I scarcely
know where we've been, except that they were all the
most expensive places. Any woman who reads this story
will understand me when I say I made a bee-line for those
shops that don't put very much in the show-window.</p>

<p>Just one perfect gown on a stand, perhaps, one
filmy dream of a lingerie blouse, a pair of silk stockings
that looked as if they'd been fashioned by the
fairies out of spun sunset, and a French girl's name
splashed in bold white letters across the pane&mdash;that was
the sort of decoration of the establishments patronised
by Miss Million and her maid.</p>

<p>As before, the maid (myself) had to do all the ordering,
while the heiress shrank and slunk and cowered in
the background. For poor little Million was really too
overawed for words by those supercilious and slim
young duchesses in black satin, the shop assistants who
glided towards us with a haughty "What may I show
you, Moddom?" From "undies" (all silk) to corsets
(supple perfection!), through ready-made costumes to
afternoon frocks and blouses and hats and evening-gowns
I made my relentless way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;68]</span>
After the first few gasps from Million of "Oh, far
too expensive.... Oh, Miss!... Haven't they any
cheaper than.... Twenty? Lor'! Does she mean
twenty shillings, Miss Beatrice? What! Twenty
pounds? Oh, we can't&mdash;&mdash;" I left off asking the prices
of things. I simply selected the garments or the hats
that looked the sweetest and harmonised the best with
my new employer's black hair and bright grey frightened
eyes. I heard myself saying with a new note of
authority in my voice: "Yes! That'll do. And the
little shoes to match. And two dozen of these. And
put that with the others. I will have them all sent
together." What did money matter, when it came to
ordering an outfit for a millionairess?</p>

<p>I grew positively intoxicated with the mad joy of
choosing clothes under these conditions. Isn't it the
day-dream of every human being who wears a skirt?
Isn't it "what every woman wants?" A free hand for
a trousseau of all new things! To choose the most desirable,
to materialise every vision she's ever had of the
Perfect Hat, the Blouse of Blouses, and to think
"never mind what it costs!"</p>

<p>And this, at last, had fallen to my lot. I quite forgot
that I was not the millionairess for whom all this
many-coloured and soft perfection was to be sent
"home"&mdash;"to the Hotel Cecil, I'll trouble you." I
only remembered that I was the millionairess's maid
when one of the black-satin duchesses, in the smartest
hat shop, informed me that I "could perfectly wear"
the little Viennese hat with the flight of jewelled humming-birds,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;69]</span>
and I had had to inform her that the hat
was intended for "the other lady."</p>

<p>"We'll do a little shopping for me, now," I decided,
when we left that hat-shop divinity with three new creations
to pack up for Miss Million at the Cecil. I said:
"I'm tired of people not knowing exactly what I am.
I'm going to choose a really 'finished' kit for a superior
lady's-maid, so that everybody shall recognise my
'walk in life' at the first glance!"</p>

<p>"Miss! Oh, Miss Beatrice, you can't," protested
Million, in shocked tones. "You're never going to wear&mdash;livery,
like?"</p>

<p>"I am," I declared. "A plain black gown, very perfectly
cut, an exquisite muslin apron with a little bib,
and a cap like&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Miss! You can't wear a cap," declared little Million,
standing stock still at the top of Bond Street and
gazing at me as if I had planned the subversion of all
law and order and fitness. "All very well for you to
come and help me, as you might say, just to oblige, and
to be a sort of companion to me and to call yourself my
maid. But I never, never bargained for you, Miss Beatrice,
to go about wearing no caps! Why, there's plenty
of young girls in my own walk of life&mdash;I mean in what
used to be my own walk! Plenty of young girls who
wouldn't dream of being found drowned in such a thing
as a cap! Looks so menial, they said. Several of the
girls at the Orphanage said they'd never put such a
thing on their heads once they got away. And a lady's-maid,
well, 'tisn't even the same as a parlour-maid! And
you with such a nice head of hair of your own, Miss
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;70]</span>
Beatrice!" Million expostulated with almost tearful incoherence.
"A reel lady's-maid isn't required to wear a
cap, even if she does slip on an apron!"</p>

<p>"You shut up," I gaily commanded the employer
upon whom I now depend for my daily bread. "I am
going to wear a cap. And to look rather sweet in it."</p>

<p>And I did.</p>

<p>For when I'd spent the two quarters' salary that
I'd ordered Million to advance to me, I looked at
myself in a long glass at the establishment where they
seem particularly great on "small stock sizes"&mdash;my
size. I beheld myself a completely different shape from
the lumpy little bunch of a girl that I'd been in blue
serge that seemed specially designed to hide every decent
line of her figure. I was really quite as graceful
as the portrait of Lady Anastasia herself! This was
thanks to the beautifully built, severely simple gown,
fitted on over a pair of low-cut, glove-like, elastic
French stays. The dead-black of it showed up my long,
slim throat (my one inheritance from my great-grandmother!),
which seemed as white as the small, impertinently
befrilled apron that I tied about my waist. The
cap was just a white butterfly perched upon the bright
chestnut waves of my hair.</p>

<p>And the general effect of Miss Million's maid at that
moment was of something rather pretty and fetching
in the stage-lady's maid line, from behind the footlights
at Daly's. I'm sorry to have to blow my own trumpet
like this, but after all it was the first time I'd ever
seen myself look so really nice. I thought it was quite
a pity that there was no one but Million and the girl
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;71]</span>
in the "maids' caps department" to admire me! Then,
for some funny, unexplained reason, I thought of somebody
else who might possibly catch a glimpse of me
looking like this. I thought of the blue-eyed, tall,
blonde manager of the bank where Million has opened
her account; Mr. Reginald Brace, who lives next door
to where we used to live; the honest, pleasant-voiced person
whom I look upon as such a good match for Million;
the young man who's arranged to come and have tea
with her at her hotel next Thursday.</p>

<p>He will be the very first caller she's had since she
ceased to be little Nellie Million, the maid-of-all-work.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_72" id="Pg_72">[Pg&nbsp;72]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>AN OLD FRIEND OF THE FAMILY</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">I was</span> <i>wrong</i>.</p>

<p>She will have another caller first.</p>

<p>In fact, she has had another caller. When we got
back to our&mdash;I really must remember to say her&mdash;rooms
at the Cecil we were met, even as I unlocked the
door, by a whiff of wonderful perfume, heady, intoxicating.
The scent of carnations. A great sheaf of
the flowers was laid on the table near the window. Red
carnations, Carmen's carnations, the flowers that always
seem to me to stand for something thrilling....
In the language of flowers it is "a red rose" that spells
the eternal phrase, "I love you." But how much more
appropriate would be one handful of the jagged petals
of my favourite blood-red carnations!</p>

<p>"Lor'! Ain't these beauties!" cried Million, sniffing
rapturously. "Talk about doin' things in style!
Well, it's a pretty classy kind of hotel where they gives
you cut flowers like this for your table decorations."</p>

<p>"My dear Million, you don't suppose the hotel provided
these carnations," I laughed, "as it provided the
palms downstairs?"</p>

<p>"Lor'! Do I pay more money for 'em, then, Miss&mdash;Smith,
I mean?"</p>

<p>"Pay? Nonsense. The flowers have been sent in
by some one," I said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;73]</span>
"Sent? Who'd ever send flowers to me?"</p>

<p>I thought I could guess. I considered it a very
pretty attention of Mr. Reginald Brace, Million's only
new friend so far, the young bank manager.</p>

<p>I said: "Look and see; isn't there a note with the
flowers?"</p>

<p>Million took up the fragrant sheaf. Something
white was tucked in among the deep red blooms.</p>

<p>"There is a card," she said. She took it out, and
glanced at it. I heard her exclaim in a startled voice:
"Lor'! Who may he be when he's at home?"</p>

<p>I looked up quickly.</p>

<p>"What?" I said. "Don't you remember who Mr.
Brace is?"</p>

<p>"I remember Mr. Brace all right, Miss&mdash;Smith, I
mean. But these here ain't from no Mr. Brace," said
Million, in a voice of amazement. "Look at the card!"</p>

<p>I took the card and read it.</p>

<p>On one side was:</p>

<p class="blockquot1">"To Miss Million, with kindest greetings from an
old friend of the family!"</p>

<p>On the other side was the name:</p>

<p class="blockquot1">"The Honourable James Burke, Ballyneck, Ireland."</p>

<p>"The Honourable!" echoed Million, breathing heavily
on the H in "honourable." "Now who in the wide
world is the gentleman called all that, who thinks he's
a friend of my family (and one that hasn't any family),
whoever's he?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;74]</span>
"It's very mysterious," I agreed, staring from the
flowers to the card.</p>

<p>"Must be some mistake!" said Million.</p>

<p>An idea occurred to me.</p>

<p>"Ring the bell, Million," I said. Then, remembering
my place, I crossed the room and rung the bell
myself.</p>

<p>"For the chamber-maid. She may be able to tell us
something about this," I explained. "We'll ask her."</p>

<p>More surprises!</p>

<p>The rather prim-faced and middle-aged chamber-maid
who appeared in answer to our summons had a startling
announcement to make in answer to my query as to
who was responsible for that sheaf of glorious carnations
that we had found waiting.</p>

<p>"The flowers, Madam, yes. Mr. Burke gave them
to me himself with orders that they were to be placed
in Miss Million's room."</p>

<p>"Yes," I answered for Miss Million; "but who is
this Mr. Burke? That is what we&mdash;I mean that is
what Miss Million wants to know."</p>

<p>The sandy eyebrows of the chamber-maid rose to the
top of her forehead as she replied: "Mr. Burke? I understood,
Madam, that&mdash;&mdash;" Then she stopped and
began again: "Mr. Burke is staying in the hotel just
now, Madam."</p>

<p>A sudden presentiment chilled me. I glanced from
the small, ill-clad figure of the new heiress sitting at
the table with her carnations, through the open door
into her bedroom with the pyramidal new trunks which
had attracted their full share of glances this morning!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;75]</span>
Then I looked back to the chamber-maid standing there
so deferentially in front of the two worst-dressed people
at the Cecil. And I said quickly: "Is he&mdash;is Mr.
Burke the man who drove up in the four-in-hand this
morning?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Madam. A black-and-yellow coach with four
white horses; that would be Mr. Burke's party."</p>

<p>"Lor'!" broke for the fiftieth time this day from
the lips of Million. "That young gentleman with all
those grand people, and the trumpet" (this was the
posthorn), "and what not? Him with the red rose in
his buttonhole?" Million was as red as that rose in
her flattered excitement, as she spoke. "Well, I never!
Did you ever, Miss&mdash;er&mdash;Smith! Did you ever? Sending
me in these beautiful flowers and all. Whatever
made him think he knew me?"</p>

<p>"I can't say, Madam," took up the chamber-maid,
"but I certainly understood from Mr. Burke that he
knew your family&mdash;in the States, I think he said."</p>

<p>"Would that be me uncle that I got my money
from?" murmured the artless Million to me.</p>

<p>I thought of the confab that I'd overheard in the
central hall between the hotel porter and that loudly
dressed young man who had raised his hat as we
passed. It had been ascertained for him, then, that
Miss Million and "The Sausage King" had something
to do with each other! Awful young man! Million,
looking visibly overcome, murmured: "Fancy dad's
own brother having such classy friends out there! A
Honourable! Doesn't that mean being relations with
some duke or earl?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;76]</span>
"Mr. Burke is the second son of Lord Ballyneck,
an Irish peer, I believe, Madam," the chamber-maid informed
us&mdash;or rather me. I wish all these people
wouldn't turn to me always, ignoring the real head of
affairs, Million. Never mind. Wait until I've got her
into her new gowns, and myself into the cap and apron!
There'll be a difference then!</p>

<p>The chamber-maid added: "Mr. Burke left a message
for Miss Million."</p>

<p>"A message&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, Madam; he said he would give himself the
pleasure of calling upon you to-morrow afternoon
here at about four o'clock, to have a talk about
mutual friends. I said that I would let Miss Million
know."</p>

<p>"Glory!" ejaculated Million, as the chamber-maid
withdrew. "Jer hear that, Miss Beatrice?"</p>

<p>"I hear you calling me by my wrong name again,"
I said severely.</p>

<p>"Smith, I mean! D'you take it in that we're going
to have that young gentleman coming calling here to-morrow
to see us? Oh, lor'! I shall be too nervous to
open my mouth, I know.... Which of me new dresses
d'you think I'd better put on, M&mdash;Smith? Better be
the very grandest I got, didn't it? Oh! I shall go
trembly all over when I see him again close to, I know
I shall," babbled Million, starry-eyed with excitement.
"Didn't I ought to drop him a line to thank him for
them lovely flowers and to say I shall be so pleased to
see him?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not!" I said firmly. "In the first place,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;77]</span>
I don't think you ought to see him at all." Million
gaped at me.</p>

<p>"Not see&mdash;&mdash;But he's coming here to call!"</p>

<p>My voice sounded as severe as Aunt Anastasia's own
as I returned: "I don't think he seemed a very desirable
sort of visitor."</p>

<p>"Not&mdash;&mdash;But, Miss, dear, you heard what the
maid said. He's a Honourable!"</p>

<p>"I don't care if he's a Serene Highness. I didn't
like the look of him."</p>

<p>"I thought he looked lovely!" protested the little
heiress, gazing half-timidly, half-reproachfully upon
me. "Look at the beautiful kind smile he'd got, and so
good-lookin'! And even if he wasn't a lord's son, you
could see at a glance that he was a perfect gentleman,
used to every luxury!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I daresay," I began. "But&mdash;well! I don't
know how to explain why I don't think we&mdash;you ought
to get to know him, Million. But I don't. For one
thing, I heard him making inquiries about you as we
went through this afternoon. I heard him tell the hall
porter to find out if you had anything to do with Mr.
Million, of Chicago!"</p>

<p>"Very natural kind of remark to pass," said little
Million. "Seeing new people come in, and knowing
uncle's name. It's because of uncle, you see, that he
wants to make friends."</p>

<p>"Because of uncle's money!" I blurted out rather
brutally.</p>

<p>"Oh, Miss&mdash;oh, Smith!" protested Million, all reproachful
eyes. "What would he want with more
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;78]</span>
money, a young gentleman like that? He's got no end
of his own."</p>

<p>"How do you know?"</p>

<p>"But&mdash;w'y! Look at him!" cried Million. "Look
at his clothes! Look at that lovely coach an' those
horses&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Very likely not his own," I said, shaking my head
at her. "My dear Million&mdash;for goodness' sake remind
me to practise calling you 'Miss'; I'm always reminding
you to practise not calling me it! My dear Miss
Million, I feel in all my bones one sad presentiment.
That young man is a fortune-hunter. I saw it in his
bold and sea-blue eye. As it says in the advertisement,
'It's your money he wants.' I believe he's the sort of
person who makes up to any one with money. (I expect
all those other men he was with were rich enough.)
And I don't think you ought to make friends with this
Mr. Burke until we've heard a little more about him.
Certainly I don't think you ought to let him come and
see you here without further preliminaries to-morrow
afternoon!"</p>

<p>"What am I goin' to do about it, then?" asked
Million in a small voice.</p>

<p>Her mouth drooped. Her grey eyes gazed anxiously
at me, to whom she now turns as her only guide, philosopher,
and friend. She was evidently amazed that I
didn't share her impressions of this "lovely" young
"Honourable." She had wanted to see him "close to"&mdash;a
fearful joy! She had meant to dress up in her
grandest new finery for the occasion. And now she
was woefully disappointed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;79]</span>
Poor little soul!</p>

<p>Yes; evidently her eyes had already been dazzled by
that vision this morning outside the Cecil; that gay
picture that had looked like some brightly coloured
smoking-room print. The brilliant, lemon-yellow-and-black
coach, the postilion behind, the spanking white
horses, the handsome, big, ruddy-faced young sportsman
who was driving....</p>

<p>But it was my duty to see that only her eyes were
caught. Not her heart&mdash;as it probably would be if
she saw much more of that very showy young rake!
And not her fortune.</p>

<p>I said, feeling suddenly more grown-up and sensible
than I've ever been in my life: "You will have to leave
word that you are not at home to-morrow afternoon."</p>

<p>"Very well, Miss Smith," said my employer blankly.
She sat for a minute silent in the hotel easy-chair, holding
the carnations. Then her small, disappointed face
lighted up a little.</p>

<p>"But I shall be at home," she reminded me, with
a note of hope in her tone. "Got to be. It's Thursday
to-morrow."</p>

<p>"What about that?" I said, wondering if Million
were again harking back to the rules of her previous
existence. Thursday is my Aunt Anastasia's "day"
for the stair-rods and the fenders, and the whole of
No. 45 is wont to reek with Brasso. Could Million
have meant&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>She took up: "Don't you remember? Thursday
afternoon was when that other young gentleman was
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;80]</span>
going to drop in. Him from the bank. That Mr.
Brace. He'll be coming. You said he might."</p>

<p>"So he is," I said. "But that won't make any difference.
You'll be 'at home' to him. Not to Mr.
Burke. That's all."</p>

<p>"I can't be in two places at once, and they're both
coming at four," argued the artless Million. "How
can I say I'm not at home, when&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Million! It just shows you never could have
been in service in very exalted situations," I laughed.
"Don't you know that 'not at home' simply means you
don't wish to see that particular visitor?"</p>

<p>Little Million's whole face was eloquent of the retort.
"But I do wish to see him!" She did not say it.
She gave a very hard sniff at the carnations in her
hand, and suggested diffidently and rather shakily:
"P'raps Mr. Brace might have liked to see another
gentleman here? More company for him."</p>

<p>I paused before I answered.</p>

<p>A sudden thought had struck me.</p>

<p>Men are supposed to be so much better at summing
up other men's characters at a glance than women
are.</p>

<p>In spite of what Aunt Anastasia has said about "insufferable
young bounders," I believe that this Mr.
Reginald Brace is a thoroughly nice, clear-sighted sort
of young man. I feel that one could rely upon his
judgment of people. I'm sure that one could trust him
to be sincere and fair.</p>

<p>Why not consult him about this new, would-be friend
of Million's?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;81]</span>
Why not be guided by him? He was the only available
man I could be guided by, after all.</p>

<p>So I said: "Well, Million, on second thoughts, of
course, if you have another man here, it isn't quite the
same thing as receiving this Mr. Burke by himself. It
puts him on a different footing. And&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"D'you mean I may have him here after all, Miss?"
cried Million, lighting up again at once. "Mr. Burke,
I mean."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, have him," I said resignedly. "Have both
of them. We'll see what happens when they meet."</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_82" id="Pg_82">[Pg&nbsp;82]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>THE DAY OF THE PARTY</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">To-day's</span> the day!</p>

<p>At four o'clock those two young men are coming to
the Hotel Cecil, where for the first time it will be a
case of "Miss Million at home."</p>

<p>And to begin with Miss Million and her maid have
had quite a fierce argument.</p>

<p>I knew it was coming. I scented it afar off as soon
as Million had sent off her formal little note (dictated
by me) to the Hon. James Burke at this hotel.</p>

<p>As soon as we had settled which of all her new gowns
the little hostess was going to wear for this event she
turned to me. Obviously suppressing the "Miss Beatrice,"
which still lingers on the tip of her tongue, Million
asked: "And what are you goin' to put on?"</p>

<p>"Put on?" I echoed with well-simulated surprise,
for I knew perfectly what she meant. I braced myself
to be firm, and took the bull by the horns.</p>

<p>"I shan't have to 'put on' anything, you see," I
explained. "I shall always be just as I am in this
black frock and this darling little frilly apron, and
the cap that I really love myself in. You can't say it
doesn't suit me, Mill&mdash;&mdash;, Miss Million."</p>

<p>The scandalised Million stared at me as we stood
there in her hotel bedroom; a sturdy, trim little dark-haired
figure in her new princesse petticoat that showed
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;83]</span>
her firmly developed, short arms, helping me to put
away the drifts of superfluous tissue-paper that had
enwrapped her trousseau. I myself had never been so
well dressed as in this dainty black-and-white livery.</p>

<p>She exclaimed in tones of horror: "But you can't sit
down to afternoon tea with two young gentlemen in
your cap and apron!"</p>

<p>"Of course not. I shan't be sitting down with them
at all."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"I shan't be having tea with you in the drawing-room,"
I explained. "Naturally I shall not appear
this afternoon."</p>

<p>"Wha&mdash;what'll you do, then?"</p>

<p>"What does a good lady's-maid do? Sit in her
bedroom, sorting her mistress's new lingerie and sewing
name-tapes on to her mistress's silk stockings&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What! And leave me alone, here?" remonstrated
my mistress shrilly. "Me sit here by myself with
those two young gentlemen, one of them a Honourable
and a perfect stranger to me, and me too nervous to
so much as ask them if they like one lump or two in
their cups of tea? Oh, no! I couldn't do it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You'll have to," I said. "Ladies'-maids do not
entertain visitors with their employers."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;&mdash;'Tisn't as if I was an ordinary employer!
'Tisn't as if you was an ordinary lady's-maid!"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is, exactly."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;they'll know you aren't. Why, that young
Mr. Reginald Brace, him from the bank, he knows as
well as you do who you are at home!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;84]</span>
"That has nothing to do with him, or with your
tea-party."</p>

<p>"I don't want no tea-party if I'm goin' to be left
all on me own, and nobody to help me talk to
that Honourable," Million protested almost tearfully.
"Lor'! If I'd a known, I'd never have said the gentlemen
could come!"</p>

<p>"Nonsense," I laughed. "You'll enjoy it."</p>

<p>"'Enjoy!' Oh, Miss&mdash;Smith! Enjoyment and me
looks as if we was going to be strangers," declared Million
bitterly. "I don't see why you couldn't oblige a
friend, and come in to keep the ball a-rollin', you that
know the go of Society, and that!"</p>

<p>"I'm sure it's not the go of Society to have in the
lady's-maid to help amuse the visitors. Not in the
drawing-room, at all events."</p>

<p>"But if I ask you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If you ask me to do things that are 'not my place,'
Miss Million," I said firmly, "I shall give you notice.
I mean it."</p>

<p>This awful threat had its effect.</p>

<p>Million heaved one more gusty sigh, cast one more
reproachful glance at her rebellious maid, and dropped
the subject.</p>

<p>Thank goodness!</p>

<p>I shall miss this weird and unparalleled party, but
I shall hear all about it at second-hand after that
amazingly contrasted couple of young men has departed.</p>

<p>It's ten minutes to four now.</p>

<p>I have "set the scene" perfectly for this afternoon's
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;85]</span>
festivity. A hotel sitting-room can never look like a
home room. But I've done my best with flowers, and
new cushions, and a few pretty fashion journals littered
about; also several new novels that I made Million
buy, because I simply must read them. Yes, I've
arranged the room. I've arranged the carnations. (I
hope Mr. Burke will think they look nice.) I've arranged
the tea; dainty Nile-green cakes from Gunter's,
and chocolates and cigarettes. I've arranged the trembling
little hostess.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Miss Million," I said firmly, as I prepared
to depart. "You needn't be nervous; you look
very nice in the white French muslin with the broad
grey-blue ribbon to match your best feature, your eyes.
Very successful."</p>

<p>"Looks so plain, to me," objected little Million unhappily.
"You might have let me put on something
more elabyrinth. Nobody'd ever believe I'd been and
gone and given as much as fifteen guineas for this
thing."</p>

<p>"Anybody would know, who knew anything," I consoled
her. "And I'll tell you one thing. A man like
Mr. Burke knows everything. Give him my love&mdash;no.
Mind you don't!"</p>

<p>"I shall be too scared to say a word to him," began
Million, whimpering. "You might&mdash;&mdash;" I shut the
door.</p>

<p>I went into my room across the corridor and prepared
to spend a quiet, useful, self-effacing afternoon
with my work-basket and my employer's new
"pretties."</p>

<p class="blockquotr"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;86]</span>
<span class="smcap">Later</span>.<br />
</p>

<p>What a different afternoon it has turned out to be!</p>

<p>I suppose it was about twenty minutes later, but
scarcely had I embroidered the first white silken "M"
on Million's new crêpe-de-chine "nightie" than there
was a light tap at my door. I thought it was my
own tea.</p>

<p>"Come in," I called.</p>

<p>Enter the sandy-haired, middle-aged chamber-maid.
She stood, looking mightily perplexed.</p>

<p>Well, I suppose we are rather a perplexing proposition!
Two girls of twenty-three, turning up at the
Hotel Cecil with highly luxurious-looking but empty
baggage, and clad as it were off a stall at some country
rectory jumble sale! Blossoming forth the next
day into attire of the most chic and costly! One girl,
with a voice and accent of what Aunt Anastasia still
calls "the governing class," acting as maid to the other,
whose accent is&mdash;well, different. I wonder what the
chamber-maid thinks?</p>

<p>She said: "Oh, if you please&mdash;"</p>

<p>(No "madam" this time, though she was obviously
on the verge of putting it in!)</p>

<p>"&mdash;if you please, Miss Million sent me to tell you
that she wished her maid to come to her at once."</p>

<p>Good gracious! This was an unexpected move.</p>

<p>An "S O S" signal, I supposed, from Million in
distress! My employer, utterly unable to cope with the
situation and the "strange young gentlemen alone,"
had ordered up reinforcements! An order! Yes, it
was an order from mistress to maid!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;87]</span>
My first impulse was frankly to refuse. I wonder
how many maids have felt it in their time over an
unbargained-for order?</p>

<p>"Tell her I'm not coming." This was what I nearly
said to the chamber-maid.</p>

<p>Then I remembered that one couldn't possibly say
things like that.</p>

<p>I sat for another second in disconcerted silence, my
needle, threaded with white silk, poised above the
nightie.</p>

<p>Then I said: "Tell Miss Million, please, that I will
be with her in a moment."</p>

<p>At the time I didn't mean to go. I meant to sit on,
quietly sewing, where I was until the visitors had gone.
Then I could "have it out" with Million herself afterwards....</p>

<p>But before I put in three more stitches my heart
misgave me again.</p>

<p>Poor little Million! In agonies of nervousness!
What a shame to let her down! And supposing that
she, in her desperation, came out to fetch me in!</p>

<p>I put aside my work and hastened across the corridor
to my employer's sitting-room. As I opened the
door I heard an unexpected sound. That sound seemed
to take me right back to our tiny kitchen in Putney,
when Aunt Anastasia was out, and Million and I were
gossiping together.</p>

<p>Million's laugh!</p>

<p>Surely she couldn't be laughing now, in the middle
of her nervousness!</p>

<p>I went in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;88]</span>
A charming picture met me; a picture that might
have hung at the Academy under the title of "Two
Strings to Her Bow" or "The Eternal Trio," or
something else appropriate to the grouping of two
young men and a pretty girl.</p>

<p>The girl (Million), black-haired, white-frocked, and
smiling, was sitting on a pink-covered couch, close to
one of the young men&mdash;the bigger, more gorgeously
dressed one. This was, of course, Mr. James Burke.
He looked quite as effective as he had done in his coaching
get-up. For now he wore a faultless morning-coat
and the most George-Alexandrian of perfectly creased
trousers. His head was as smoothily and glossily black
as his own patent-leather boots. "Seen close to," as
Million puts it, he was showily good-looking, especially
about the eyes, with which he was gazing into the little
heiress's flushed face. They were of that death-dealing
compound, deep blue, with thick, black lashes. What a
pity that those eyes shouldn't have been bestowed by
Providence upon some deserving woman, like myself, instead
of being wasted upon a mere man. But possibly
the Honourable James didn't consider them waste.
He'd made good use of them and of his persuasive
voice, and of his time generally, with Miss Million, the
Sausage King's niece!</p>

<p>They were sitting there, leaving the other poor
young man looking quite out of it, talking as if they
were the greatest friends. As to Million's nervous terror,
I can only say, in her own phrase, that "nervousness
and she were strangers!" That Irishman had
worked a miracle; he'd put Million at ease in his presence!
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;89]</span>
I came right in and stood looking as indescribably
meek as I knew how.</p>

<p>My employer looked up at me with an odd expression
on her small face.</p>

<p>For the first time there was in it a dash of "I-don't-care-what-you-think-I-shall-do-what-I-like!"
And for
the first time she addressed me without any hesitation
by the name that I, Beatrice Lovelace, have taken as
my <i>nom de guerre</i>.</p>

<p>"Oh, Smith," said Million&mdash;Miss Million, "I sent
for you because I want you to pour out the tea for us.
Pourin' out is a thing I always did 'ate&mdash;hate."</p>

<p>"Yes, Miss," I said.</p>

<p>And I turned to obey orders at the tea-table.</p>

<p>As meekly as if I'd been put into the world for
that purpose alone, I began to pour out tea for Miss
Million and her guests.</p>

<p>The tea-table was set in the alcove of the big window,
so that I had to turn my back upon the trio. But
I could feel eyes upon my back. Well! I didn't mind.
It was a gracefully fitted back at last, in that perfectly
cut, thin black gown, with white muslin apron-strings
tied in an impertinent little bow.</p>

<p>There was a silence in the room where the hostess had
been laughing and the principal guest&mdash;I suppose she
looked upon this Mr. Burke as the principal guest&mdash;had
been purring away to her in that soft Irish voice
of his.</p>

<p>I filled the cups and turned&mdash;to meet the honest sunburnt
face of the other visitor, Mr. Reginald Brace.
He'd got up and taken a quick step towards me. I
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;90]</span>
never saw anything quite so blankly bewildered as his
expression as he tried hard not to stare at that little
white muslin butterfly cap in my hair.</p>

<p>Of course! This was his first intimation that I, who
had been Million's mistress, was now Miss Million's
maid!</p>

<p>In a dazed voice he spoke to me: "Can't I&mdash;&mdash;Do
let me help you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you," I said quietly and businesslikely.
"Will you take this to Miss Million, please?"</p>

<p>He handed the cups to the others, and I followed
and handed the cream, milk, and sugar. It felt like
acting in a scene out of some musical comedy, at the
Gaiety, say. And I daresay it looked like it, what with
the pretty, flower-filled sitting-room, and Million's
French white muslin with the grey-blue sash, and my
stage-soubrette livery, and the glossily groomed Mr.
Burke as the young hero! I surprised a very summing-up
glance from those black-lashed blue eyes of
his as I waited on him. How is it that every syllable
spoken in a certain kind of Irish voice seems to mean a
compliment, even if it's only "thank you" for the sugar?
I went back and stood as silent and self-effacing
as a statue, or a really well-trained servant, by the tea-things,
while the Honourable James Burke went on improving
the shining hour with his millionaire hostess.</p>

<p>This was the sort of conversation that had been going
on, evidently, from the start:</p>

<p>"Isn't it an extraordinary thing, now, that I should
be sitting here, cosily talking to you like this, when
just at this same time last year, my dear Miss Million,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;91]</span>
I was sitting and talking to that dear old uncle of yours
in Chicago?" he said. "Every afternoon I used to go
and sit by his bedside&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A year ago, was it?" put in Million. "Why, Mr.
Burke, I never knew uncle had been poorly so long as
that; I thought he was taken ill quite sudden."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, of course. So he was," Mr. Burke put in
quickly. "But you know he had an awful bad doing
a good time before that. Sprained his ankle, poor old
boy, and had to lie up for weeks. Awfully tedious for
him; he used to get so ratty, if you don't mind my
saying so, Miss Million. He used to flare up in his
tempers like a match, dear old fellow!"</p>

<p>"Well, I never. I'm rather that way myself," from
the delighted Million, who was obviously hanging on
every word that fell from the young fortune-hunter's
improvising lips. "Must be in the family!"</p>

<p>"Ah, yes; it always goes with that generous, frank,
natural disposition. Always hasty as well! So much
better than sulking, I always think," from the Irishman.
"When it's over, it's over. Why, as your dear
old uncle used to say to me, 'Jim,' he'd say&mdash;he always
called me Jim&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Did he really, now?" from Million. "Fancy!"</p>

<p>Yes, it was all "fancy," I thought.</p>

<p>As I stood there listening to that glib West of Ireland
accent piling detail on detail to the account of the
Honourable Jim's friendship with the old Chicago millionaire
a queer conviction strengthened in my mind.
I didn't believe a word of it!</p>

<p>"One of the best old chaps I ever knew. Hard and
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;92]</span>
crusty on the outside&mdash;a rough diamond, if you know
what I mean&mdash;but one of Nature's own gentlemen. I'm
proud to think he had a good opinion of me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>All a make-up for the benefit of the ingenuous,
ignorant little heiress to whom he was talking! He
was brazenly "pulling" Miss Million's unsophisticated
leg! Honourable or not, he was an unscrupulous adventurer,
this Jim Burke! And the other young man&mdash;the
young bank manager, who sat there balancing a
cup of tea in one hand and one of the pale-green Gunter's
cakes in the other? He hadn't a word to say.
There he sat. I glanced at him. He looked wooden.
But behind the woodenness there was disapproval, I
could see. Disapproval of the whole situation. Ah! I
shouldn't have to ask him what he thought of the Honourable
Jim Burke. I could read Mr. Brace's opinion
of him written in every line of Mr. Brace's clean-shaven,
honest face that somehow didn't look so handsome this
afternoon. Showiness such as that of the big, black-haired,
blue-eyed Irishman is enough to "put out" the
light of any one else! Why, why did I allow Million
to meet him? He'd take care that this was not the
only time! He was taking care of that.</p>

<p>I heard him saying something about taking Miss
Million on the coach somewhere. I saw Miss Million
clap her hands that are still rather red and rough from
housework, manicure them as I will.</p>

<p>"What, me! On a coach? What, with all them lovely
white horses and that trumpeter?" cried Million gleefully.
"Would I like it? Oh, Mr. Burke!"</p>

<p>Mr. Burke immediately began arranging dates and
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;93]</span>
times for this expedition. He said, I think, "the day
after to-morrow&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Oh, dear! What am I going to do about this? Forbid
her to go? Up to now everything that I have said
has had such an immense influence upon little Million.
But now? What about that quite new gleam of defiance
in her grey eyes? Alas! the influence of one girl
upon the actions of another girl may be as "immense"
as you please, but wait until it is countermined by some
newly appeared, attractive young scoundrel of a man!
(I am sure he is a scoundrel.)</p>

<p>I foresee heated arguments between my young mistress
and myself, with many struggles ahead.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I feel that my only hope lies in Mr.
Brace. Without a word passing between us, I felt that
he understood something of my anxiety in this situation.
He might be able to help me, though I think I
should have thought more of him if he had tried to talk
a little this afternoon instead of allowing the conversation
to consist of a monologue by that Irishman, punctuated
by rapturous little Cockney comments from Miss
Million.</p>

<p>He, Mr. Brace, left first.</p>

<p>I glided away from my station at the table to open
the door for him.</p>

<p>"Thank you," he said. "Good afternoon, Miss
Lovelace." I must see him again, or write to him, to
ask for his help, I think!</p>

<p>The Honourable Jim tore himself from Million's side
about five minutes later.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Miss Million. I wish I could tell you
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;94]</span>
how much it's meant to me, meeting my old friend's
niece in this way," purred the golden voice, while the
Honourable Jim held Million's little hand in his and
gazed down upon the enraptured face of her. One sees
faces like that sometimes outlining the gallery railing at
a theatre, while below the orchestra drawls out a phrase
of some dreamy waltz and, on the stage, the matinée
hero turns his best profile to the audience and murmurs
thrillingly: "Little girl! Do you dream how different
my life could be&mdash;with <span class="smcap">you</span>?"</p>

<p>It wouldn't surprise me in the least if the Honourable
Jim had made up his mind to say something of
the sort to Million, quite soon!</p>

<p>Of course, his life would be "different" if he had
heaps of money. Somehow I can't help feeling that,
in spite of his clothes and the dash he cuts, he hasn't
a penny to his name.</p>

<p>"Good-bye. <i>A bientôt</i>," he said to Million.</p>

<p>Oh, why did I ever bring her to the Cecil? As the
door closed behind her visitor Million breathed a heavy
sigh and said, just as those theatre-going girls say at
the drop of a curtain: "Wasn't he lovely?"</p>

<p>Then she threw herself down on to the couch, which
bounced. Something fell from it on to the floor.</p>

<p>"There, if he hasn't left his walkin'-stick be'ind
him!" exclaimed Million, picking up a heavy ebony
cane with a handsome gold top to it. I realised that
here was an excuse, hatched up by that conscienceless
young Celt, to return shortly.</p>

<p>Million didn't see that. She exclaimed: "Now I've
got to run after him with it, I s'pose&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;95]</span>
"No, you haven't, Miss Million. I will take it. It's
the maid's place," I interposed. And quickly I took
the cane and slipped out into the corridor with it.</p>

<p>I caught up with the tall visitor just as he reached
the lift.</p>

<p>"You left your cane in Miss Million's room, sir,"
I said to him in a tone as stiff as that of a lady's-maid
turned into a pillar of ice.</p>

<p>The big Irishman turned. But he did not put out his
hand for the cane at once.</p>

<p>He just said, "That's very kind of you," and smiled
at me. Smiled with all those bold blue eyes of his.
Then he said in a voice lower and more flattering even
than he had used to the heiress herself: "I wanted a
word with you, Miss Lovelace, I think they call you.
It's just this&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused, smiled more broadly all over his handsome
face, and added these surprising words:</p>

<p>"What's your game, you two?"</p>

<p>"Game!&mdash;I beg your pardon!" I said haughtily. (I
hope I didn't show how startled and confused I was.
What could he mean by "our game"?)</p>

<p>I gazed up at him, and he gave a short laugh. Then
he said: "Is it because nothing suits a pretty woman
better than that kit? Is it just because you know the
man's not born that can resist ye in a cap and apron?"</p>

<p>I was too utterly taken aback to think of any answer.
I thrust the cane into his hands, and fled back,
down the corridor, into my mistress's room. And, as
I went in, I think I heard the Honourable Jim still
laughing.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3>MY FIRST "AFTERNOON OUT"</h3>

<p class="noindent">"<span class="smcap">Don't</span> you think it's about time you went and had
an afternoon out, Smith?"</p>

<p>This was the remark addressed to me by my employer
the morning after the afternoon of her first tea-party.</p>

<p>For a moment I didn't answer. The fact is I was too
angry! This is absurd, of course. For days I've
scolded Million for forgetting our quick change of positions,
and for calling me "Miss" or "Miss Beatrice."
And yet, now that the new heiress is beginning to realise
our respective rôles and to call me, quite naturally, by
the name which I chose for myself, I'm foolishly annoyed.
I feel the stirring of a rebellious little thought.
"What cheek!"</p>

<p>This must be suppressed.</p>

<p>"You know you did ought to have one afternoon a
week," our once maid-of-all-work reminded me as she
sat in a pale-blue glorified dressing-gown in front of
the dressing-table mirror. I had drawn up a lower
chair beside her, and was doing my best with the nails
of one of her still coarse and roughened little hands,
gently pushing the ill-treated skin away from the "half-moons."
Million's other hand was dipped into a
clouded marble bowl full of warm, lemon-scented emollient
stuff.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;97]</span>
"Here you've been doin' for me for well over the
week now, and haven't taken a minute off for yourself."</p>

<p>"Oh, I haven't wanted one, thanks," I replied rather
absently.</p>

<p>I wasn't thinking of what Million was saying. I was
pondering rather helplessly over the whole situation;
thinking of Million, of her childish ignorance and her
money, of myself, of that flattering-tongued, fortune-hunting
Irishman who had asked me in the corridor what
"our game" was, of that coach-drive that he intended
to take Million to-morrow, of what all this was going
to lead to.</p>

<p>"Friday, this afternoon. I always had Fridays off.
You'd better take it," the new heiress said, with quite
a new note of authority. "You can pop out dreckly
after lunch, and I shan't want you back again until it's
time for you to come and do me up for late dinner."</p>

<p>Miss Million dines in her room; but she is, as she
puts it, "breakin' in all her low-cut gowns while she's
alone, so as to get accustomed to the feel of it."</p>

<p>I looked at her.</p>

<p>I thought, "Why does she want me out of the way?"</p>

<p>For I couldn't help guessing that this was at the
bottom of Miss Million's offering her maid that afternoon
out!</p>

<p>I said: "Oh, I don't think there's anywhere I want
to go to, just yet."</p>

<p>"Better go, and have it settled, like. Makes it more
convenient to you, and more convenient to me, later on,
if we know exactly how we stand about your times off,"
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;98]</span>
said Million quite obstinately. "I shan't want you
after two this afternoon."</p>

<p>This she evidently meant quite literally.</p>

<p>I shall have to go, and to leave her to her own devices.
I wonder what they will be? Perhaps an orgy
of more shopping, without me, buying all the cerise
atrocities that I wouldn't allow her to look at. Garments
and trimmings of cerise would be a pitfall to
Miss Million but for her maid. So would what she calls
"a very sweet shade of healiotrope." Perhaps it's
worse than that, though. Perhaps she's having Mr.
Burke to tea again, and wishes to keep it from the maid
who said such disapproving things about him. I shall
have to leave that, for the present.... I shall just
have to take this afternoon out.</p>

<p>I went out, wondering where I should go. My feet
seemed of their own accord to take me westwards,
through Trafalgar Square and Pall Mall. I walked
along, seeing little of the sauntering summer crowds.
My mind was full of my own thoughts, my own frettings.
I'd cut myself off from my own people, and
what was going to come of it? Not the glorious independence
I'd hoped for. No; a whole heap of new difficulties,
and anything but a free hand wherewith to cope
with them!</p>

<p>I came out of this rather gloomy reflection to find
myself in Bond Street. That narrow, Aristocrat-of-all-the-Thoroughfares
has seen a good deal of Miss Million
and her maid during the last couple of days. Not much
of a change for my afternoon off! I didn't want to do
any more shopping; in fact, I shan't be able to do any
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;99]</span>
more shopping for myself for the next six months, seeing
that of the two quarters' salary that I asked Miss
Million to advance me there remains about five shillings
and sixpence.</p>

<p>But I might give myself a little treat; say, tea in a
nice place with a good band and a picture-gallery first.
That might help me to forget, for an hour or so, the
troubles and trials of being the lady's-maid to a millionairess.</p>

<p>This was why I paid away one of my few remaining
shillings at the turnstile of the Fine Art Society, and
sauntered into the small, cool gallery.</p>

<p>There was rather an amusing picture-show on.
Drawings of things that I myself had been up to my
eyes in for the last day or so; the latest fashions for
nineteen-fourteen! Drawings by French artists that
made clothes, fashion-plates, look as fascinating and as
bizarre as the most wonderful orchids. Such curious
titles, too, were given to these clever little pictures of
feminine attire: "It is dark in the park"; "A rose
amid the roses."</p>

<p>There was one picture of a simple frock made not
unlike Miss Million's white muslin with the blue sash,
but how different frocks painted are from frocks worn!
Or was it that the French manikin in the design knew
how to wear the&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>My thoughts were suddenly interrupted by a voice
speaking above my shoulder, speaking to me:</p>

<p>"Ah! And is this where Miss Million's maid gathers
her inspirations for dressing Miss Million?"</p>

<p>I knew who this was, even before I turned from the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;100]</span>
pictures to face what looked like another very modern
fashion-plate. A fashion-design for the attire of a
young man about town, the Honourable Jim Burke!
So he wasn't calling on Miss Million again this afternoon,
after all! That ought to be one weight off my
mind; and yet it wasn't. I felt curiously nervous of
this man. I don't know why. He raised his glossy hat
and smiled down at me. He spoke in the courteous tone
of one enchanted to meet some old acquaintance. "Good
afternoon, Miss Lovelace!"</p>

<p>A maid may not cut her mistress's chosen friends,
even on her afternoon out. I was obliged to say "Good
afternoon," which I did in a small and icy voice. Then,
in spite of myself, I heard myself saying: "My name is
Smith."</p>

<p>The Honourable Jim said coolly: "Oh, I think not?"</p>

<p>I said, standing there, all in black, against the gay
background of coloured French drawings: "Smith is
the name that I am known by as Miss Million's
maid."</p>

<p>"Exactly," said the big young Irishman gently,
looking down at me and leaning on his ebony, gold-headed
stick.</p>

<p>He added, almost in a friendly manner: "You know,
that's just what I've been wanting to have a little talk
to you about."</p>

<p>"A talk to me?" I said.</p>

<p>"Yes, to you, Miss Smith-Lovelace," he nodded.
"You do belong to the old Lovelace Court Lovelaces,
I suppose. The Lady Anastasia lot, that had to let the
place. Great pity! Yes! I know all about you," said
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;101]</span>
this alarming young man with those blue eyes that
seemed to look through my face into the wall and out
again into Bond Street. "Let's see, in your branch
there'll be only you and the one brother left, I believe?
Lovelace, Reginald M., Lieutenant Alexandra's Own,
I.A. What does he think of this?"</p>

<p>"Of which?" I fenced, not knowing what else to say
to this surprising and disconcerting person. "You
seem to know a good deal about people's families, Mr.
Burke." This I thought was a good way of carrying
the war into the enemy's own country, "or to say you
do."</p>

<p>I added this with great emphasis. I meant him to
realise that I saw through him. That I'd guessed it was
all pure romancing what he had been murmuring yesterday
to my unsuspecting little mistress about his
friendship with her uncle.</p>

<p>That would astonish this young fortune-hunter,
thought I. That would leave him without a word to
say for himself. And then he'd leave me. He'd turn
and go, foiled. And even if he persisted in his attentions
to the dazzled Miss Million, he would remain in
a very wholesome state of terror of Miss Million's maid.
This was what I foresaw happening in a flash. Picture
my astonishment, therefore, at what did happen.</p>

<p>The young man took me up without a quiver.</p>

<p>"Ah, you mean that affecting little yarn about old
man Million, in Chicago, don't you?" he said pleasantly.
"Very touching, you'll agree, the way I'd cling
to his bedside and put up with his flares of temper, the
dear old (Nature's) gentleman&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;102]</span>
I would have given yet another quarter's salary not
to have done what I did at this moment. I laughed.</p>

<p>That laugh escaped me&mdash;I don't know how. How
awful! There I stood in the gallery, with only a sort
of custodian and a couple of art-students about, laughing
up at this well-dressed, showy, unprincipled Irishman
as if we were quite friends! I who disapproved of
him so utterly! I who mean to do all in my power to
keep him and Million's money apart!</p>

<p>He said: "Didn't I know you had a sense of humour?
Let us continue this very interesting conversation among
the Polar landscapes downstairs. That's what I came
in here to see. We'll sit and admire the groups of
penguins among the icebergs while we talk."</p>

<p>"No; I don't think we will," said I. I didn't mean
to do anything this young man meant me to. I wasn't
Million, to be hypnotised by his looks and his clothes
and his honeyed Irish voice, forsooth. "I don't care
to see those photographs. Not a bit like the Pole,
probably. I am not coming down, Mr. Burke."</p>

<p>"Ah, come along," he persisted, smiling at me as he
stood at the top of the stairs that led to the other exhibition.
"Be a good little girl and come, now!"</p>

<p>"Certainly not," I said, with considerable emphasis
on the "not."</p>

<p>I repeated steadily: "I am not coming. I have nothing
to talk to you about. And, really, I think I have
seen quite enough&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of you!" was my unspoken ending to this sentence.
These "asides" seem to sprinkle one's conversations
with words written, as it were, in invisible ink.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;103]</span>
How seldom can one publish them abroad, these mental
conclusions of one's remarks! No, no; life is quite
complicated enough without that.... So I concluded,
rather lamely, looking round the gallery with the drawings
of Orientalised Europeans: "I have seen quite
enough of this exhibition. So I am going&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To have tea, of course. That is a very sound
scheme of yours, Miss Lovelace," said Mr. Burke
briskly but courteously. "You'll let me have the pleasure
of taking you somewhere, won't you?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not," I said again. This time the emphasis
was on the "certainly." Then, as I was turning
to leave the gallery, I looked again at this Mr. Burke.
He may be what my far-away brother Reggie would call
"a wrong 'un." And I believe that he is. But he
is certainly a very presentable-looking wrong 'un&mdash;far
more presentable than I, Beatrice Lovelace, am&mdash;was, I
mean. Thank goodness, and my mistress's salary,
there is absolutely no fault to be found with my entirely
plain black outdoor things. And, proportionately, I
have spent more of the money on my boots, gloves, and
neckwear than on the other part of my turn-out.
There's some tradition in our family of Lady Anastasia's
having laid down this law. It is quite "sound,"
as Mr. Burke called it.</p>

<p>Now this presentable-looking but otherwise very discreditable
Mr. Burke was quite capable of following me
wherever I went. And if there is one thing I should
loathe it is any kind of "fuss" in a public place. So, I
thought swiftly, perhaps the best way of avoiding this
fuss is to go quietly&mdash;but forbiddingly&mdash;to have tea.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;104]</span>
I needn't let him pay for it. So I said coldly to the big
young man at my heels in the entrance: "I am going
to Blank's."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said Mr. Burke pleasantly, "we are going
to White's. Don't you like White's?"</p>

<p>I had never been there in my life, of course, but I
did not tell him so.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3>CREAM AND COMPLIMENTS</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">In</span> a few minutes we were sitting opposite to each other
at a pretty table in the upper room. We were close to
the window and could look down on the Bond Street
crowd of people and cars. In front of us was the daintiest
little tea that I had ever seen. This young man is,
of course, accustomed to ordering the sort of tea that
women like?</p>

<p>"And this is the second time that you have poured
out tea for me, Miss Lovelace!" remarked the Honourable
Jim Burke, as he took the cup from my hand.
"Admirable little hostess that you are, remembering
not to ask me whether I take sugar; storing up in your
mind that what I like is a cupful of sugar with a little
tea to moisten it!"</p>

<p>This was quite true.</p>

<p>I felt myself blush as I sat there. Then I glared
at him over the plate of delicious cakes. The young
man smiled; a nice smile, that one must allow.</p>

<p>"You look like a little angry black pigeon now.
You've just the movements of a pigeon ready to peck
at some one, and the plumage," he said, with a critical
blue eye on my close-fitting black jacket. "All it lacks
is just a touch of bright coral-red somewhere. A chain,
now; a charm on the bangle; a flower. It's to you I
ought to have sent those carnations, instead of to
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;106]</span>
your&mdash;&mdash;Do you call her your mistress, that other
girl? That one with the voice? Mad idea, the whole
arrangement, isn't it? Just think it over for a moment,
and tell me yourself. Don't you think it's preposterous?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;er&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>I didn't know what to say. I bit into one of the
little cakes that seemed all chocolate and solidity outside.
Inside it was all cream and soft-heartedness and
sherry flavouring, and it melted over on to the crisp
cloth.</p>

<p>"There, now, look what a mess you're making," commented
the young Irishman with the undeservedly
pleasant voice. "Try one of these almondy fellows
that you can see what you're doing with. To return to
you and your masquerade as Miss Million's maid&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is not a masquerade," I explained with dignity.
"I don't know what you mean by your&mdash;I am in Miss
Million's service. I am her maid!"</p>

<p>"Have some strawberries and cream. Really fine
strawberries, these," interpolated the Honourable Jim.
"What was I saying&mdash;you her maid? Wouldn't it be
just as sensible if I myself were to go and get myself
taken on as valet by that other young fellow that was
sitting there at tea in her rooms yesterday&mdash;the bank
manager, or whatever he was? Curious idea to have a
deaf-and-dumb chap as a manager."</p>

<p>Here I really had to bite my lips not to laugh again.
Certainly poor Mr. Brace had descended, like Mr.
Toots, into a well of silence for the whole of that afternoon.
I daresay he thought the more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;107]</span>
"When I heard at the Cecil that all those boxes
and things belonged to the very young lady with her
maid, naturally enough I thought I knew which of the
two was the mistress," pursued the Honourable Jim
in a sort of spoken reverie, eating strawberries and
cream with the gusto of a schoolgirl. "Then when I
came up and saw the wrong one waiting on the other,
and looking like a picture in her apron&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Please don't say those things to me," I interrupted
haughtily.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Because I don't like it."</p>

<p>"It's a queer disposition the Lovelace women must
be of, then. Different from the others. To take offence?
To shy at the sound of a man's voice saying
how sweet they look in something they've got new to
wear? I will remember that," said Mr. Burke, still in
that tone of reverie. With every word he spoke I
longed more ardently to feel very angry with this
young man. Yet every word seemed to make genuine
anger more impossible. Sitting there over his strawberries
and cream, he looked like some huge, irresponsible,
and quite likeable boy. I had to listen to him. He
went on: "Then when I saw you as the maid, I thought
you'd just changed places for a joke. I made sure
'twas you that were Miss Million."</p>

<p>"What?" I cried.</p>

<p>For now I really was angry.</p>

<p>It was the same kind of hot, unreasonable, snobbish
anger that surged all over me when Million (my mistress)
began to lose her habit of saying "Miss," and of
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;108]</span>
speaking to me as if I'd come from some better world.
Utterly foolish and useless anger, in the circumstances.
Still, there it was. I flushed with indignation. I looked
straight at the Honourable Jim Burke as I said furiously:
"Then you really took me&mdash;me!&mdash;for the niece
of that dreadful old&mdash;of that old man in Chicago?"</p>

<p>"I did. But, remember," said Mr. Burke, "I'd never
set eyes on that old man."</p>

<p>"Ah! You admit that, then," I said triumphantly
and accusingly, "in spite of all that long story to Miss
Million. You admit yourself that it was all a make-up!
What do you suppose Miss Million will say to
that?"</p>

<p>The young fortune-hunter looked at me with perfect
calm and said: "Who's to tell her that I admitted
I'd never seen her old uncle?"</p>

<p>"To tell her? Why!" I took up. "Her maid!
Supposing I go and tell her&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, but don't you see? I'm not supposing any
such thing," said Mr. Burke. "You'll never tell, Miss
Lovelace."</p>

<p>"How d'you know?"</p>

<p>"I know," he said. "Don't I know that you'd never
sneak?"</p>

<p>And, of course, this was so true. Equally, of course,
I was pleased and annoyed with him at the same time
for knowing it. I frowned and stared away down Bond
Street. Then I turned to him again and said: "You
said to me yesterday, 'What is your game?'"</p>

<p>"So I did. But now that I've found out you're
not the heiress herself, I know what your game is."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;109]</span>
"What?"</p>

<p>"The same as mine," declared this amazing young
fortune-hunter, very simply. "Neither of us has a
penny. So we both 'go where money is.' Isn't that it,
now?"</p>

<p>"No, no!" I said hotly. "You are hatching up an
introduction to Miss Million, deceiving her, laughing at
her, plotting against her, I expect. I'm just an ordinary
lady's-maid to her, earning my wages."</p>

<p>"By the powers, they'll take some earning before
you're done," prophesied the young Irishman, laughing,
"mark my words. You'll have your work cut out for
you, minding that child let loose with its hands full of
fireworks. I feel for you, you poor little girl. I do,
indeed."</p>

<p>"Really. You&mdash;you don't behave as if you did.
People like you won't make my 'work' any easier,"
I told him severely. "You know you are simply turning
Miss Million's head, Mr. Burke."</p>

<p>"Oh, you wrong me there," he said solemnly.</p>

<p>"I don't wrong you at all. I see through you perfectly,"
I said. And I did. His mouth might be perfectly
grave, but blue imps were dancing in his eyes.
"You are flattering and dazzling poor Mi&mdash;my mistress,
just because she has never met any one like you
before!"</p>

<p>"Ah! You've met so many of us unprincipled men
of the world!" sighed Mr. Burke. "I daren't hope to
impose on your experience, Miss Lovelace. (We'll
have two lemon water ices, please"&mdash;to the waitress.)</p>

<p>"No, but you are imposing on her," I scolded him,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;110]</span>
"with your&mdash;your stories of knowing her uncle, and
all that. And now you're&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, what are my other crimes?"</p>

<p>I took breath and said: "You're asking her out for
drives in that coach of yours&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Would to Heaven it were my coach," sighed Lord
Ballyneck's youngest son. "It belongs to my good pal
Leo Rosencranz, that turn-out! I am merely&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What I want to know is," I broke in very severely,
"where is all this going to lead to?"</p>

<p>He took the wafer off his ice before replying. Then
he said very mildly: "Brighton, I thought."</p>

<p>Isn't an Irishman the most hopeless sort of person to
whom to try to talk sense? Particularly angry sense!</p>

<p>"I don't mean the coach-drive," I said crossly.
"You knew that, Mr. Burke. I mean your acquaintance
with my employer. Where is that going to lead to?"</p>

<p>"I hope it's going to lead to mutual benefits," announced
the Honourable Jim briskly. "Now, since
you're asking me my intentions like this, I'll tell them
to you. I've never before had the knife laid to my throat
like this, and by a bit of a chestnut-haired girl, too!
Well, I intend to see a good deal of Miss Million. I
shall introduce to her a lot of people who'll be useful,
one way and another. Haven't I sent two friends of
mine to call on her this afternoon?"</p>

<p>"Have you?" I said.</p>

<p>So that was the reason Million insisted on my taking
the afternoon off! She didn't intend me to see his
friends! I wondered who they were.</p>

<p>Mr. Burke went on: "Between ourselves, I intend
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;111]</span>
to be a sort of Cook's guide through life to your young
friend&mdash;your employer, Miss Million. A young woman
in her position simply can't do without some philanthropist
to show her the ropes. Perhaps she began by
thinking you might be able to do that, Miss&mdash;Smith?"
he laughed softly. He said: "But I shall soon have her
turning to me for guidance as naturally as a needle
turns to the north. I tell you I'm the very man to help
a forlorn orphan who doesn't know what to do with a
fortune. Money, by Ishtar! How well I know where
to take it! Pity I never have a stiver of my own to do
it with!"</p>

<p>"You haven't?" I said.</p>

<p>"Child, I'm a pauper," he replied. "The descendant
of Irish kings; need I say more? There's not a
page-boy at the Cecil who hasn't more ordinary comforts
in his home than I have. My father's the poorest
peer in Ireland. My brother's the poorest eldest son;
and I&mdash;I tell you I can't afford to spend a week at
Ballyneck; the damp in the rooms would ruin my
clothes; the sound of the rats rompin' up and down
the tapestry would destroy my high spirits; and then
where'd I be?"</p>

<p>I looked at him. He, too, then, was of the nouveaux-pauvres,
the class that is sinking down, down under the
scrambling, upward-climbing feet of the successful.
But he took the situation in a different spirit from the
way in which my Aunt Anastasia took it. He frankly
made what he could out of it. He hoisted the Jolly
Roger and became a pirate on the very seas that had
engulfed the old order.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;112]</span>
Disgraceful of him.... One ought not to wish to
listen to what he had to say.</p>

<p>"Champagne tastes on a beer income; that's bad.
But here's this little&mdash;this little Million girl with a
champagne income and no tastes at all yet. I shall be
worth half her income to her in consequence," he announced.
"I shall be able to give her priceless tips.
Advice, you know, about&mdash;oh, where to buy all the
things she'll want. The cars. The wines and cigars.
(Even a grown-up woman isn't often to be trusted about
those.) The country house she'll have to take. What
about Lovelace Court, Miss Lovelace? Care to have her
there, in case the people who have got it want to turn
out? I've no doubt I could wangle that for you, if you
liked."</p>

<p>I said, feeling bewildered, and flurried, and amused
all at once: "What is 'wangle'?"</p>

<p>The Honourable Jim Burke laughed aloud as he devoured
his lemon water ice.</p>

<p>"You'll know the meaning of that mystic verb before
you have known me very long," he said. "It's
the way I make my living."</p>

<p>I looked at him, sitting there so debonair and showy
in his expensive raiment, talking so cynically in that
golden voice. So typically one of "our" world, as Aunt
Anastasia prophetically calls it; yet so ready to rub
shoulders with every other kind of world that there
may be&mdash;Jews, theatrical people, hotel porters, pork-butchers,
heiresses!</p>

<p>I asked, rather inquisitively: "Make your living
how? What do you do?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;113]</span>
"People, mostly," said the Honourable Jim with a
cheery grin.</p>

<p>No; there's no getting any truth or any sense out of
a man like that.</p>

<p>Just before we rose from the tea-table I said to him:
"And the end of it all? I suppose you'll marry&mdash;I
suppose you'll get Miss Million to marry you!"</p>

<p>"Marry?" said Mr. Burke with a little quick movement
of his broad chest and shoulders. An odd movement!
It seemed mixed up of a start, a shudder, and a
shaking aside of something. "Marry? A woman with
a voice like that? And hands like that?"</p>

<p>This touched my professional pride as manicurist
and lady's-maid. I told him: "Her hands are much
better since I've been looking after them!"</p>

<p>"They must have been pretty rough-hewn," said Mr.
Burke, candidly, "before!"</p>

<p>"Of course, they were in a horrid state," I said unguardedly.
"But yours would be red and rough if
you'd had to scrub and to wash up and to black-lead
fireplaces&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What? Had the little Million been doing all that
before she came into Uncle's money?" cried the Honourable
Jim, with delighted interest beaming all over
his face. "Truth is stranger than cinema films! Tell
me on, now; where was this Dollar Princess in service?"</p>

<p>"With m&mdash;&mdash;" I began. Then I shut my lips with
a snap. What was happening? This young man that
I had meant to cross-examine was simply "pumping"
me! Not only that, but I was very nearly getting to
the point of being ready to tell him anything he asked.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;114]</span>
How had this come about? Anyhow, it must not be.
I put on a very forbidding look and said: "I shall not
tell you where Miss Million was."</p>

<p>"Haven't ye told me? She was with you or your
relatives. If that isn't the grandest joke!" chuckled
this unsuppressable young man. "Don't attempt to
deny it, for I see it all now. Isn't it the finest bit of
light opera? Isn't it better than me wildest dreams?
And how did she shape, the heiress? What sort of a
character would you give her? Was she an early riser&mdash;honest,
obliging? Could she wait at table? And is it a
bit of her own she's getting back now, setting you to
hand round the cups?" He laughed aloud. "Can't I
see it all now&mdash;the pride of her? She that was waiting
on you, she's got you to skivvy for her now! Oh, I
wouldn't have missed this Drama of the Domestic Servant
Problem! Don't hope to keep me out of the stalls,
Miss Lovelace, after this! It's in the front row I
shall be in future for every performance!"</p>

<p>With this alarming threat he finished his ice and
laughed once more, joyously. While I was debating
what to say, he took up the conversation again.</p>

<p>"Tell me, are you going to get Miss Million's hands
to look exactly like yours?" he asked, fastening his
eyes on my fingers. I clenched my fists and hid them
away under the table. "Ah, but I noticed them at once.
And your voice? Are you going to teach her to speak
exactly as you do? Because, when that happens&mdash;&mdash;"
He paused (at last).</p>

<p>"Well?" I said, beginning to put on my new gloves.
"When that happens, what?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;115]</span>
"Why, then I shall certainly beg her to marry me,"
declared the Irishman. "Faith, I'll go down on my
knees to the girl then."</p>

<p>"Not until then?" I suggested. I was really anxious
to get through this baffling young man's nonsense. I
wanted to find out what he really meant to do about all
this.</p>

<p>But he only shook his head with that mock-solemn
air. He only said: "Child, who knows what's going
to happen to any of us, and when?"</p>

<p>Half the way back to the Cecil (Mr. Burke had hailed
a taxi for me and had then got into it with me) I was
wondering what I am to say to my mistress, Miss Million,
about the happenings of my afternoon out. How
am I to break it to her that I spent nearly the whole
of it in the society of a young man against whom I
have been warning her&mdash;Million&mdash;ever since he first
sent in his card?</p>

<p>"Does your Miss Million allow flowers?" Mr. Burke
said cheerfully as we whizzed down the Haymarket.
"To you, I mean?"</p>

<p>It was an outrageous thing to say. But in that
voice it somehow didn't sound outrageous, or even disrespectful.
The voice of the Celt, whether Irish, Highland-Scottish,
or Welsh, does always seem to have the
soft pedal down on it. And it's a most unfair advantage,
that voice, for any man to possess.</p>

<p>I said hastily: "Really, I don't think you need speak
to me as if I were a maid on her afternoon&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here I remembered that this was exactly what I
was. And again I was forced into reluctant laughter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;116]</span>
"You've no business to be taking the job on at all,"
said the young man at my side in the taxi, quite gravely
this time. "Was there nothing else you could do, Miss
Lovelace?"</p>

<p>"No; nothing."</p>

<p>"What about woman's true sphere? You ought to
get married."</p>

<p>"Very easy to say that, for a man," I said. "How
could I get married?"</p>

<p>Really earnestly he replied: "Have you tried?"</p>

<p>"No! Of course not!"</p>

<p>"You should," he said. He looked down at me in
a curious, kindly way. He said: "I've wangled things
harder than that both for myself and my friends. Men
like a wife that can wear diamonds as if they belonged
to her; a wife that can talk the same language as some
of their best clients. Well! Here's a charming young
girl, with looks, breeding, and a fine old name. Can
do!" he brought his flat hand down on the top of his
ebony cane, and added, "Have you a hatred of foreigners?"</p>

<p>"Foreigners?" I repeated, rather breathless again
over the sudden conversational antics of a young man
who can't be serious for two seconds together. "Foreigners?
What for?"</p>

<p>"Why, for a husband! Supposing now that I were
to introduce to you a fellow I knew, a fellow with 'a
heart of gold' and pretty well everything else in metal
to match it, like all these German Jews&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>I gasped: "You think I ought to marry a German
Jew?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;117]</span>
"That's just the merest idea of mine. Startled you,
did it? We'll discuss it later, you and I. But it'll take
time. Lots of time&mdash;and, by Jove! There isn't any
too much of that now," he exclaimed, glancing at his
wrist-watch as we passed the lions of Trafalgar Square,
"if I'm to get back to your&mdash;to our Miss Million&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is she expecting you," I asked rather sharply,
"again?"</p>

<p>"She is not. But here are these two friends of
mine calling on her; and I'm bound to put in an appearance
before they leave. Rather so! I'm not turning
them loose on any new heiresses, without keeping
my eye on what they're up to," explained the Honourable
James Burke with his usual bland frankness. "So
here I stop the taxi."</p>

<p>He got out. I saw him feel in all his pockets, and
at last he took out half a sovereign. (The last, I daresay.)</p>

<p>Then he turned to me. "I'll give you three minutes'
start, child, to get back to the hotel and into that cap
and apron of yours. One more word.... Go through
the lounge, and you'll see the animals feeding. Go on,
man"&mdash;to the taxi driver: "The Hotel Cecil; fly!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<h3>A DIFFERENT KIND OF PARTY</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Miss Million</span> and her callers were having tea in the
bigger "lounge," or whatever they call the gilded hall
behind the great glass doors which shut it off from the
main entrance.</p>

<p>Now, this was the first time that my mistress had
plucked up courage to take a meal downstairs since we
had come to the Cecil.</p>

<p>I wondered how she'd been getting on. I must see!</p>

<p>So, still in my outdoor things, I passed the glass
doors. I walked into the big tea-room. There were
palms, and much gilding, and sofas, and dark-eyed,
weary-looking waiters wheeling round little carts
spread with dainties, and offering the array of éclairs
and flat apple-cakes to the different groups&mdash;largely
made up of American visitors&mdash;who were sitting at the
plate-glass-topped tables.</p>

<p>I couldn't see Million&mdash;Miss Million's party&mdash;anywhere
at first!</p>

<p>I looked about....</p>

<p>At the further end of the place a string band, half-hidden
behind greenery, was playing "I Shall Dream of
You the Whole Night." Peals of light laughter and
ripples of talk came from a gay-looking group of frocks&mdash;with
just one man's coat amongst them&mdash;gathered
around a table near the band.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;119]</span>
I noticed that the eyes of everybody within earshot
were turning constantly towards this table. So I looked,
too.</p>

<p>At whom were they all staring? At a plump, bright-haired
woman in all-white, who was obviously entertaining
the party&mdash;to say nothing of the rest of the
room.</p>

<p>She had a figure that demanded a good deal of
French lingerie blouse, but not much skirt. The upright
feather in her hat was yellow; jewelled slides
glittered in her brass-bright hair; her eyes were round
and very black.</p>

<p>She reminded me of a sulphur-crested, white cockatoo
I had seen at the Zoo.</p>

<p>But where had I seen her before? She puzzled and
fascinated me. I stood a little way off, forgetting my
errand, watching this vivacious lady, the centre of the
group. She was waving her cigarette to punctuate her
remarks&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, young Jim's one of the best&mdash;the very best,
my dears. Tiptop family and all. Who says blood
doesn't tell, Leo? Ah! he's a good old pal o' mine,
is the Hon. Jim Burke, specially on Fridays (treasury
day, my dear); but it's the Army I'm potty about myself.
The Captain (and dash the whiskers), that's the
tiger that puts Leo and his lot in the shade&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here followed a wave of the cigarette towards the
only man of the party. He was stout and astrachan-haired;
a Jew even from the back view.</p>

<p>"Give me the military man, what, what," prattled
on the cockatoo lady, whose cigarette seemed to spin
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;120]</span>
a web about her of blue floating smoke wisps. "That's
the boy that makes a hole in Vi's virgin heart!"</p>

<p>A fan-like gesture of her left hand, jewelled to the
knuckles, upon the spread of the lady's embroidered
blouse emphasised this declaration.</p>

<p>"Them's the fellers! Sons of the Empire&mdash;or of
the Alhambra!" wound up the cockatoo lady with a
rollicking laugh.</p>

<p>And as she laughed I caught her full face and the
flash of a line of prominent, fascinatingly white teeth
that lighted up her whole expression as a white wave
lights up the whole shore.</p>

<p>Then I knew where I'd seen her before&mdash;in a hundred
theatrical posters between the Hotel Cecil and the
Bond Street tea-shop that I had just left. Yes, I'd
seen this lady's highly coloured portrait above the announcement:</p>

<p class="center">
MISS VI VASSITY,<br />
<span class="smcap">London's Love</span>.<br />
<span class="smcap">England's Premier Comedienne!</span>
</p>

<p>So that was who she was!</p>

<p>Beside her on the couch a couple of younger girls,
also rather "stagily" dressed, were hanging on every
word that fell from the music-hall favourite's vermilioned
lips.</p>

<p>With her back to me, and with her chair drawn a
little aside from the others, there sat yet another woman.
She was enormously tall and slim, and eccentrically clad
in Oriental draperies of some sombre, richly patterned
stuff. This gave her the air of some graceful snake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;121]</span>
She turned and twisted the whole of her long, lissom
person, now putting up a hand to smooth her slim
throat, now stretching out a slender ankle; but all the
time posing, and admiring the poses in the nearest mirror.
She was scarcely listening to Miss Vi Vassity's
chatter.</p>

<p>"Tea? Any more, anybody?" Miss Vassity's
black eyes glanced about her. "Baby? Sybil?
Lady G.?" (the latter to the cobra-woman).</p>

<p>"You, my dear?" turning to some one who was
hidden behind her. "Half a cup&mdash;oh, come on now.
It'll have to be a whole cup; we don't break our china
here, as my dear old mother used to say at Baa-lamb.</p>

<p>"You know I sprang from the suburbs, girls, don't
you? Better to spring than to sink, eh, Miss Millions&mdash;and
trillions? Here you are; I'll pour it out."</p>

<p>The music-hall idol leant forward to the tea-tray.
Beyond her sumptuous shoulder I caught a glimpse at
last of the woman who'd been hidden.</p>

<p>I gasped with surprise. She was my Miss Million!</p>

<p>Yes! So these were the friends whom Mr. Burke
had sent to call on her! And there she sat&mdash;or shrank&mdash;she
who was supposed to be the hostess of the party!</p>

<p>Beneath her expensive new hat&mdash;quite the wrong one
to wear with that particular frock, which she changed
when I went out&mdash;her face was wide-eyed and dazed.
She who had shown so much self-confidence at her last
tea-party with just those two young men had lost
it all in the midst of these other people.</p>

<p>There she sat, silent, lips apart, bewildered eyes moving
from one to the other. Between the languid, posing
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;122]</span>
cobra-woman and the gay, chattering, sulphur-crested
cockatoo, she looked like a small hypnotised rabbit.</p>

<p>I slipped up to her with my best professional manner
on.</p>

<p>"Did you want me for anything, Miss?" I asked in
my lowest and most respectful tone.</p>

<p>Poor little Million's face lighted up into a look of
the most pathetic relief as she turned and beheld her
one friend in that tea-room.</p>

<p>"Ow! S-Smith! Come in, have you?" she exclaimed,
giggling nervously. Then, turning to the
music-hall artiste, she explained: "This is my lady's-maid!"</p>

<p>"And very nice, too!" said Miss Vi Vassity
promptly, with one of those black-eyed glances that
seemed to swing round from me to Million, thence to
the cobra-woman, the other girls, the stout young Jew,
all of whom were staring hard at me.</p>

<p>She ended up in a lightning-quick wink and a quick
turn to the long glass that stood beside her teacup
which, I suppose, had contained what those people the
other day called a rattlesnake cocktail.</p>

<p>"I didn't send for you, Smith, but never mind since
you're here," my young mistress said, almost clinging
to me in her nervousness. "You can pop upstairs and
begin to put out my evening things, as usual&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Extra smart to-night, Smith, extra smart; she's
comin' on to a box at the Palace to see little Me in
my great Dazzling act," put in the actress. "Got to
be very dressy for that, old dear. Gala night at the
Opera isn't in it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;123]</span>
"The black pearl rope you'll wear, of course. And
your diamond fender to wave your hand to me in,
please!"</p>

<p>"Ow!" breathed the dismayed heiress. "Well, I&mdash;I
don't know as how I'd expected&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She hasn't acquired any ornaments at all as yet.
And, somehow, I knew that this black-eyed, bright-haired
actress knew that perfectly well. For some
reason she was pulling poor Million's leg just as mercilessly
as her precious friend the Honourable Jim&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Even as I was thinking this there strolled up the
room to our group the cool, detached, and prosperous-looking
figure of the Honourable Jim himself&mdash;the man
who had just got out of my taxi at Charing Cross.</p>

<p>Miss Vi jingled her gold mesh vanity-bag at him
with its hanging cluster of gold charms, gold pencil,
gold cigarette-case.</p>

<p>"Hi, Sunny Jim! You that know everything about
'what's worn, and where,'" she cried. "I'm just telling
your friend Miss Million that nobody'd call on her
again unless she puts on all the family diamonds for
our little supper after the show to-night!"</p>

<p>Miss Million looked anguished. She really believed
that she was going to be "let down" before her much-admired
Mr. Burke (scamp!) before the cobra-lady and
the other theatrical lights.</p>

<p>I knew how she felt!</p>

<p>She would be covered with disgrace, she would be
"laughed at behind her back" because she was a millionairess&mdash;without
any diamonds.... They'd think
she wasn't a real millionairess....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;124]</span>
I had to come to the rescue.</p>

<p>So I looked Million steadily and reassuringly in the
eye as I announced quite distinctly, but in my "quiet,
respectful" voice: "I am afraid, Miss, that there is
scarcely time to get the diamonds for to-night. You
remember that all the jewellery is at the bank."</p>

<p>Indescribable relief spread itself over Million's small
face. She felt saved. She didn't mind anything now,
not even the loudness with which the bright-haired
comedienne burst out laughing again.</p>

<p>I wonder why that shrewd, vivacious woman comes
to call on Million? It's not the money this time, surely?</p>

<p>Miss Vi Vassity must draw the largest salary of any
one on the halls? Why does she sit beaming at my
young mistress, drawing her out, watching her? And
the other, the cobra-woman; what's she doing there in
a world to which she doesn't seem to belong at all?</p>

<p>And the Jew they call Leo? Will they all be at the
party they're taking Miss Million to to-night?</p>

<p>They all burst into fresh chatter about it. Under
cover of the noise the Honourable Jim edged closer
to me and murmured, without looking at me: "All her
jewels at the bank, is it? That's not true, child, while
she has a Kohinoor&mdash;for a maid!"</p>

<p>Fearful impertinence again. But, thank goodness,
none of the others heard it.</p>

<p>And he, who's been drinking tea and chattering with
me the whole afternoon, had the grace not to glance at
me as I slipped away out of the tea-room and to the
hall.</p>

<p>Here another surprise awaited me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;125]</span>
Miss Million began to enjoy her tea-party tremendously&mdash;as
soon as it was all over and she herself was
safely back in her own bedroom with her maid.</p>

<p>She didn't seem to realise that she had only then
emerged from a state of shrinking and speechless panic!</p>

<p>"Jer see all those people, Smith, that I was having
such a fine old time with?" she exulted, as I began to
unfasten her afternoon frock.</p>

<p>"Miss Vi Vassity, if you please! Jer recanise her
from the pictures? Lor'! When I did use to get to a
music-hall to hear her, once in a blue moon, little did I
ever think I'd one day be sitting there as close to her
as I am to you, talkin' away nineteen to the dozen to
her, as if she was nobody!</p>

<p>"Wasn't that a sweet blouse she'd got on? I wonder
what she's goin' to put on to-night after the theatre;
you know we're having supper all together, her and me
and the Honourable Mr. Burke and Lady Golightly-Long,
that tall lady, and some other gentlemen and
ladies that's coming on from somewhere.</p>

<p>"And, Smith! I don't think I'm going to wear that
white frock you're putting out there," concluded my
young mistress, rather breathlessly; "there don't seem
to me to be enough style about it for the occasion; I'll
wear me cerise evening one with the spangles."</p>

<p>"Cerise? But you haven't got a cerise evening
frock," I began. "I didn't let you order that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then I caught Million's half-rueful, half-triumphant
glance at a new white carton box on the wicker chair
beside her bed. And I saw what had happened.</p>

<p>No sooner was her maid's back turned than Miss
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;126]</span>
Million had wired, or telephoned, or perhaps called at
that shop, and secured that cherry-coloured creation.
It would have looked daringly effective on&mdash;say, Miss
Lee White in an Alhambra burlesque. On little Million
it would have a vulgarity not to be described in words.
I'd thought I'd guided her safely away from it! And
now this!</p>

<p>"Yes, you see I thought better of buying that
gown," said the heiress, flushed but defiant. "You
see, you were wrong about those very bright shades
not being the c'rect thing; why, look at what that
Lady Golightly-Long had got on her back! Red and
green and blue trimmings, and I don't know what
all, all stuck on at once. And she ought to know
what's what, if anybody did," Million persisted,
"c'nsidering she's a Earl's cousin and one of the Highest
in the Land!"</p>

<p>"Certainly one of the longest," I said, thinking of
those unending lissom limbs swathed in the Futurist
draperies of that cobra-woman.</p>

<p>Million went on to inform me, impressively, that this
lady, too, was "a Perfeshional." Does classic dancing,
they call it. Needn't do it for her living, of course.
But she says she's 'wrapped up in the Art of it.' Likes
to do what she likes, I s'pose she means.</p>

<p>"She's got a lovely home of her own, Miss Vi Vassity
told me, in Aberdeenshire.</p>

<p>"Not only that, but a big bungalow she has near
the river. Sometimes she has down parties of her own
particular friends to watch her dancing on the lawn
there, in the moonlight. And, Smith!" Here Million
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;127]</span>
gave a little skip out of her skirt, "What jer
think?"</p>

<p>"What?" I asked, as I drew the cerise frock from
its wrappings. (Worse, far worse than in the shop.
Still, I'd got to let her wear it, I suppose. And it may
be drowned by Miss Vi Vassity's voice at the supper-table.)</p>

<p>"Why, she's going to ask me down there, too, to
one of her week-end parties! Think o' that! An
invitation to visit! Some time when Mr. Burke's
going. He often goes to the house. All most artistic,
he told me; and a man-cook from Vienna. Fancy!"
breathed Miss Million. "Fancy me stayin' in a house
like that!"</p>

<p>I took up her ivory brushes and began to do her
hair.</p>

<p>"You're very quiet to-night," said Million. "Didn't
you enjoy your afternoon out?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. Quite, thank you," I said rather absently.</p>

<p>I was longing to have the room to myself, with
peace and quiet to put away Miss Million's things&mdash;and
to think in. To think over "my afternoon out,"
with its unexpected encounter, its unexpected conversation!
And to meditate over that other surprise that
I'd found waiting for me at the end of it.</p>

<p>At last Miss Million was dressed. I put the beautiful
mother-o'-pearl, satin-lined wrap upon her shoulders,
sturdily made against the flaring, flimsy, cerise-coloured
ninon.</p>

<p>"Needn't wait up for me," said my mistress, bright-eyed
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;128]</span>
as a child with tremulous excitement over this new
expedition. "I'll wake you if I can't manage to undo
myself. Don't suppose I shall get back until 'the
divil's dancin' hour,' as that Mr. Burke calls it. He'll
be waitin' for me now, downstairs."</p>

<p>Really that young man lives a life of contrasts!</p>

<p>Tea with Miss Million's maid! Dinner and supper
with Miss Million herself!</p>

<p>I wonder which he considers the more amusing bit of
light opera?</p>

<p>"Pity I can't take you with me to-night, really ...
seems so lonely-like for you, left in this great place and
all," said the kind-hearted little Million at the door.
"Got something to read, have you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, thanks!" I laughed and nodded. "I have
got something to read."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<h3>A WORD OF WARNING</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">And</span> as the door shut behind my mistress I took that
"something to read" out of its hiding-place behind my
belt and my frilly apron-bib.</p>

<p>It's the letter that was waiting for me when I came
in. I've hardly had time to grasp the contents of it
yet. It's addressed in a small, precise, masculine hand:</p>

<p class="blockquotc">"To <span class="smcap">Miss Smith</span>,</p>

<p class="blockquotr">"c/o Miss Million,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="blockquotr">"Hotel Cecil."</p>

<p>But inside it begins:</p>

<p class="blockquot0">"My Dear Miss Lovelace:&mdash;"</p>

<p>And then it goes on:</p>

<p class="blockquot1">"I am putting another name on the envelope, because
I think that this is how you wish to be addressed
for business purposes. I hope you will not be offended,
or consider that I am impertinent in what I am going
to say."</p>

<p>It sounds like the beginning of some scathing rebuke
to the recipient of the letter, doesn't it? But I don't
think it's that. The letter goes on:</p>

<p class="blockquot1">"Am writing to ask you whether you will allow me
the privilege of seeing you somewhere for a few minutes'<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;130]</span>
private conversation? It is on a matter that is
of importance."</p>

<p>The last sentence is underlined, and looks most
curiosity-rousing in consequence:</p>

<p class="blockquot1">"If you would allow me to know when I might see
you, and where, I should be very greatly obliged. Believe
me,</p>

<p class="blockquotc">"Yours very truly,</p>

<p class="blockquotr">"<span class="smcap">Reginald Brace</span>."</p>

<p>That's the young manager, of course. That's the
fair-haired young man who lives next door to us&mdash;to
where we used to live in Putney; the young man of
the garden-hose and of the "rows" with my Aunt Anastasia,
and of the bank that looks after Miss Million's
money!</p>

<p>Is it about Miss Million's money matters that he
wishes to have this "few minutes' private conversation"?
Scarcely. He wouldn't come to Miss Million's
maid about that.</p>

<p>But what can he want to see me about? "A matter
of importance." What can this be?</p>

<p>I can't guess.... For an hour now I have been
sitting in Miss Million's room, with Miss Million's new
possessions scattered about me, and the scent still heavy
in the air of those red carnations sent in by the Honourable&mdash;the
Disgraceful Jim Burke.</p>

<p>Opposite to the sofa on which I am sitting there
hangs an oval mirror in a very twiggly-wiggly gilt
frame, wreathed with golden foliage held by a little
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;131]</span>
Cupid, who laughs at me over a plump golden shoulder,
and seems to point at my picture in the glass.</p>

<p>It shows a small, rather prettily built girl in a delicious
black frock and white apron, with her white
butterfly-cap poised pertly on her chestnut hair, and
on her face a look of puzzled amusement.</p>

<p>It's really mysterious; but I can't make out the
mystery. I shall have to wait until I can ask that
young man himself what he means by it all.</p>

<p>Now, as to "when and where" I am to see him.</p>

<p>Not here. I am not Miss Million. I can't invite my
acquaintances to tea and rattlesnake cocktails and gimlets
and things in the Cecil lounge. And I can scarcely
ask her to let me have her own sitting-room for the
occasion.</p>

<p>Outside the hotel, then. When? For at any moment
I am, by rights, at Miss Million's beck and call. Her
hair and hands to do; herself to dress three times a
day; her new trousseau of lovely garments to organise
and to keep dainty and creaseless as if they still shimmered
in Bond Street.</p>

<p>I don't like the idea of "slipping out" in the evenings,
even if my mistress is going to keep dissipated
hours with cobras and sulphur-crested cockatoos. So&mdash;one
thing remains to me.</p>

<p>It's all that remains to so many girls as young and
as pretty as I am, and as fond of their own way, but
in the thrall of domestic service. Oh, sacred right of
the British maid-servant! Oh, one oasis in the desert
of subjection to another woman's wishes! The "Afternoon
Off"!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;132]</span>
Next Friday I shall be free again. I must write to
Mr. Brace. I must tell him that the "important matter"
must wait until then....</p>

<p>But apparently it can't wait.</p>

<p>For even as I was taking up my&mdash;or Miss Million's&mdash;pen,
one of those little chocolate-liveried page-boys
tapped at Miss Million's sitting-room door and handed
in a card "for Miss Smith."</p>

<p>I took it.... His card?</p>

<p>Mr. Brace's card?</p>

<p>And on it is written in pencil: "May I see you at
once? It is urgent!"</p>

<p>Extraordinary!</p>

<p>Well, "urgent" messages can't wait a week! I shall
have to see him.</p>

<p>I said to the page-boy: "Show the gentleman up."</p>

<p>I don't know what can be said for a maid who, in
her mistress's absence, uses her mistress's own pretty
sitting-room to receive her&mdash;the maid's&mdash;own visitors.</p>

<p>Well, I couldn't help it. Here the situation was
forced upon me&mdash;I, in my cap and apron, standing on
Miss Million's pink hearthrug in front of the fern-filled
fireplace, and facing Mr. Brace, very blonde and
grave-looking, in his "bank" clothes.</p>

<p>"Will you sit down?" I said, standing myself as if
I never meant to depart from that attitude. He didn't
sit down.</p>

<p>"I won't keep you, Miss Lovelace," said the young
bank manager, in a much more formal tone than I had
heard from him before. "But I was obliged to call
because, after I had sent off my note to you, I found
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;133]</span>
I was required to leave town on business to-morrow
morning early. Consequently I should only be able to
speak to you about the matter which I mentioned in
my note if I came at once."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," I said. "And the important matter
was&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's about your friend, Miss Million."</p>

<p>"My mistress," I reminded him, fingering my apron.</p>

<p>The young man looked very uncomfortable.</p>

<p>Being so fair, he reddens easily. He looks much less
grown-up and reliable than he had seemed that first
morning at the bank. I wonder how this is.</p>

<p>He looked at the apron and said: "Well, if you
must call her your mistress&mdash;I don't think it's at all&mdash;but,
never mind that now&mdash;about Miss Million."</p>

<p>"Don't tell me all her money's suddenly lost!" I
cried in a quick fright.</p>

<p>The manager shook his fair head. "Oh, nothing
of that kind. No. Something almost as difficult to
tell you, though. But I felt I had to do it, Miss Lovelace."</p>

<p>His fair face set itself into a sort of conscientious
mask. "I turned to you instead of to her because&mdash;well,
because for obvious reasons you were the one to
turn to.</p>

<p>"Miss Million is a young&mdash;a young lady who seems
at present to have more money than friends. It is natural
that, just now, she should be making a number of
new acquaintances. It is also natural that she should
not always know which of these acquaintances are a
wise choice&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;134]</span>
"Oh, I know what you mean," I interposed, for I
thought he was going on in that rather sermony style
until Million came home. "You're going to warn me
that Mr. Burke, whom you met here, isn't a fit person
for Mill&mdash;for Miss Million to know."</p>

<p>Mr. Brace looked relieved, yet uncomfortable and a
little annoyed all at once.</p>

<p>He said: "I don't know that I should have put it in
exactly those words, Miss Lovelace."</p>

<p>"No, but that's the gist of it all," I said rather
shortly. Men are so roundabout. They take ages hinting
at things that can be put into one short sentence.
Then they're angry because some woman takes a short
cut and translates.</p>

<p>"Isn't that what you mean, Mr. Brace?"</p>

<p>"If I had a young sister," said this roundabout Mr.
Brace, "I certainly do not think that I should care
to allow her to associate with a man like that."</p>

<p>"Like what?" I said.</p>

<p>"Like this Mr. Burke."</p>

<p>"Why?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I don't think he is a very desirable acquaintance
for a young and inexperienced girl."</p>

<p>"How well do you know him?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh! I don't know him at all. I don't wish to
know him," said Mr. Brace rather stiffly. "I had only
seen him once before I met him in Miss Million's room
here the other day. I was really annoyed to find him
here."</p>

<p>I persisted. "Why?"</p>

<p>"Because the man's not&mdash;well, not the sort of man
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;135]</span>
your brother (if you have one) would be too pleased
to find you making friends with, Miss Lovelace."</p>

<p>"Never mind all these brothers and sisters. They
aren't here," I said rather impatiently. "What sort
of man d'you mean you think Mr. Burke is that you
want Miss Million warned against him?"</p>

<p>"I think any man would guess at the kind of man
he was&mdash;shady."</p>

<p>"D'you mean," I said, "that he cheats at cards; that
sort of thing?"</p>

<p>"Oh! I don't know that he'd do that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What does he do, then?"</p>

<p>"Ah! that's what one would like to know," said the
young bank manager, frowning down at me. "What
does he do? How does he live? Apparently in one
room in Jermyn Street, over a hairdresser's.</p>

<p>"But he's never there. He's always about in the
most expensive haunts in London, always with people
who have money. Pigeons to pluck. I don't believe
the fellow has a penny of his own, Miss Lovelace."</p>

<p>"Is that a crime?" I said. "I haven't a penny
myself."</p>

<p>Then I felt absolutely amazed with myself. Here
I was positively defending that young scamp and fortune-hunter
who had this very afternoon admitted to
me that he'd told Million fibs, and that he got what
he could out of everybody.</p>

<p>Another thing. Here I was feeling quite annoyed
with Mr. Brace for coming here with these warnings
about this other man! Yet it was only the other day
that I'd made up my mind to ask Mr. Brace for his
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;136]</span>
candid opinion on the subject of Miss Million's new
friend!</p>

<p>And now I said almost coldly: "Have you anything
at all definite to tell me against Mr. Burke's character?"</p>

<p>"Yes. As it happens, I have," said Mr. Brace
quickly, standing there even more stiffly. "I told you
that I had met the man once before. I'll tell you where
it was, Miss Lovelace. It was at my own bank. He
came to me with a sort of an introduction from a client
of ours, a young cavalry officer. He, Mr. Burke, told
me he'd be glad to open an account with us."</p>

<p>"Yes? So did Miss Million."</p>

<p>"Hardly in the same way," said Mr. Brace. "After
a few preliminaries this man Burke told me that at the
moment he was not prepared to pay anything in to his
account, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"&mdash;But what?" I took up as my visitor paused impressively,
as if before the announcement of something
almost unspeakably wicked.</p>

<p>"This man Burke actually had the assurance," said
the young bank manager in outraged tones, "the assurance
to suggest to me that the bank should thereupon
advance to him, as a loan out of his 'account,'
fifty pounds down!"</p>

<p>"Yes?" I said a little doubtfully, for I wasn't quite
sure where the point of this came in. "And then what
happened?"</p>

<p>"What happened? Why! I showed the new 'client'
out without wasting any more words," returned my
visitor severely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;137]</span>
"Don't you see, Miss Lovelace? He'd made use of
his introduction to try to 'rush' me into letting him
have ready-money to the tune of fifty pounds! Do you
suppose I should ever have seen them again? That,"
said the young bank manager impressively, "is the sort
of man he is&mdash;&mdash;" He broke off to demand: "Why do
you laugh?"</p>

<p>It certainly was unjustifiable. But I couldn't help it.</p>

<p>I saw it all! The room at the bank where Million
and I had interviewed the manager. The manager himself,
with the formal manner that he "wears" like a
new and not very comfortable suit of clothes, asking
the visitor to sit down.</p>

<p>Then the Honourable Jim, in his gorgeously cut coat,
with his daring yet wary blue eyes, smiling down at
the other man (Mr. Brace is a couple of inches shorter).
The Honourable Jim, calmly demanding fifty pounds
"on account" (of what) in that insinuating, flattering,
insidious, softly pitched Celtic voice of his ..."</p>

<p>"Common robbery. I see no difference between that
and picking a man's pocket!" declared the young manager.</p>

<p>Perfectly true, of course. If you come to think of it,
the younger son of Lord Ballyneck is no better than
a sort of Twentieth-century Highwayman. There's
really nothing to be said for him. Only why should
Mr. Brace speak so rebukefully to me? It wasn't I
who had tried to pick the pocket of his precious bank!</p>

<p>"And yet you don't see," persisted the manager,
"why a fellow of that stamp should not be admitted
to friendly terms with you!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;138]</span>
"With me? We're not talking about me at all!"
I reminded this young man. And to drive this home I
turned to the mirror and gave a touch or two to the
white muslin butterfly of the cap that marked my
place. "We're talking about my mistress. I am only
Miss Million's maid&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pshaw!"</p>

<p>"I can't pretend to dictate to my mistress what
friends she is to receive&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh!" said the young man impatiently. "That's
in your own hands. You know it is. This maid business&mdash;well,
if I were your brother I should soon put a
stop to it, but, anyhow, you know who's really at the
head of affairs. You know that you must have a tremendous
influence over this&mdash;this other girl. She naturally
makes you her mentor; models herself, or tries
to, on you. If she thought that you considered anything
or any one undesirable, she would very soon
'drop' it. What you say goes, Miss Lovelace."</p>

<p>"Does it, indeed!" I retorted. "Nothing of the
kind. It did once, perhaps. But this evening&mdash;do you
know what? Miss Million has gone out in a frock that
I positively forbade her to buy. A cerise horror that's
not only 'undesirable,' as you call it, but makes her
look&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, a frock! Why is it a woman can never keep
to the point?" demanded this young Mr. Brace.
"What's it got to do with the matter in hand what
frock Miss Million chooses to go out in?"</p>

<p>"Why, everything! Doesn't it just show what's
happening," I explained patiently. "It means that
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;139]</span>
Miss Million doesn't make an oracle of me any more.
She'd rather model herself on some of the people she's
going to supper with tonight. Miss Vi Vassity,
say&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What! That awful woman on the halls?" broke
in Mr. Brace, with as much disapproval in his voice
and tone as there could have been in my Aunt Anastasia's
if she had been told that any girl she knew
was hobnobbing with "London's Love," the music-hall
artiste.</p>

<p>"Who introduced her to Miss Million, may I ask?"
he went on. "No, I needn't ask; I can guess. That's
this man Burke. That's his crowd. Music-hall women,
German Jews, disreputable racing men, young gilded
idiots like the man in the cavalry who sent him to
me."</p>

<p>Then (furiously): "That's the set of people he'll
bring in to associate with you two inexperienced girls,"
said Mr. Brace.</p>

<p>And now his face was very angry&mdash;quite pale with
temper. He looked rather fine, I thought. He might
have posed for a picture of one of Cromwell's young
Ironsides, straight-lipped, uncompromisingly sincere,
and "square," and shocked at everything.</p>

<p>I simply couldn't help rather enjoying the mild excitement
of seeing him so wrathful.</p>

<p>Surely he must be really <i>épris</i> with Million to be so
roused over her knowing a few unconventional people.
I've read somewhere that the typical young Englishman
may be considered to be truly in love as soon as
he begins to resent some girl's other amusements.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;140]</span>
Mr. Brace went on: "And where has he taken Miss
Million to this evening, may I ask?"</p>

<p>I moved to put the cushions straight on the couch
as I gave him the evening's programme. "They were
dining at the Carlton with a party, I think. Then they
were going on to see Miss Vi Vassity's turn at the Palace.
Then they were all to have supper at a place called
the Thousand and One&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Where?" put in Mr. Brace, in a voice so horrified
that it made his remarks up till then sound quite pleased
and approving. "The Thousand and One Club? He's
taken Miss Million there? Of all places on earth! You
let her go there?"</p>

<p>He spoke as if nothing more terrible could have happened....</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<h3>REVELRY BY NIGHT</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">But</span> why am I writing all this, in view of the really
serious and terrible thing that has happened after all?</p>

<p>Yes. The most terrible thing has happened. Miss
Million has disappeared.</p>

<p>Gone! And no trace of her!</p>

<p>And I don't know where to look for her.... But
to go back to the beginning of it all&mdash;to that fatal
evening when Mr. Reginald Brace stood there in her
sitting-room, looking at me with that horrified face because
I told him she'd gone to supper at the Thousand
and One Club.</p>

<p>Five minutes after that young man's appalled-sounding
"What? You let her go there?" I was sitting in
a taxi, with him, whirling towards Regent Street.</p>

<p>"Yes; that's where she's gone," I told him, with a
queer mix-up of feelings. There was defiance among
them. What right had he to come and bully me because
I couldn't keep Miss Million and her dollars and
her new friends all under my thumb? There was anxiety....
Supposing this Thousand and One Club were
such an appallingly awful place that no young girl
ought to set foot in it? There was a queer excitement....
Well, anyhow, I might see and judge for
myself. Then I should be in a position to lecture Miss
Million about it, if necessary, afterwards!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;142]</span>
So I said: "Not only that, but I'm going there, too.
To-night. Now!"</p>

<p>"Impossible," said Mr. Brace. "Madness. Quite
impossible. You go? To a night club? You?
Alone?"</p>

<p>"No," I said on another impulse. "You'll come
with me. I've got to have a man with me, I suppose.
You'll take me, please."</p>

<p>"I shall do nothing of the sort, Miss Lovelace," said
the young bank manager, standing there in my mistress's
sitting-room as if nothing would ever dislodge
him from the spot. "Take you to that place&mdash;it's not
a place that I should ever let any sister of mine know
by sight!"</p>

<p>By this time I'd heard so much of this (non-existent)
sister of his that I almost felt as if I knew her well
(poor girl). I felt as if I were she. Yes. Mr. Brace
seemed to behave so exactly like the typical "nice" big
brother; the man who shows his respect for women by
refusing to let his own sisters see or do anything except,
say, the darning of his own socks. However, in
some way or other I managed to drive it home (this
was when we were already in the taxi) that he need not
look upon this as an evening's entertainment to which
he was escorting either his own or anybody else's sister.</p>

<p>This was part of the business of looking after Miss
Million.</p>

<p>We were at Piccadilly Circus when the young man
at my side protested: "But we can't get in, you know!
I'm not a member of this thing. I can't take you in,
Miss Lovelace&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;143]</span>
"I'm Smith, the lady's-maid of one of the ladies
who's in the club, and I've come to wait for my mistress,"
I told him. "That's perfectly simple. And I
daresay it'll allow me to see something of what's going
on!"</p>

<p>Here we drew up at a side street. It was half full
of cars and taxis, half full with a rebuilding of scaffolding
that made a tunnel over the basement.</p>

<p>The door of the club was beyond the scaffolding and
a tall commissionaire, with a breast glittering with
medals, opened and closed it with the movements of a
punkah-wallah. Inside was red carpet and a blaze of
lights and an inner glass door.</p>

<p>In this vestibule there was a little knot of men in
chauffeurs' liveries, with wet gleaming on the shoulders
of their coats, for an unexpected shower had just come
on. I was glad of it. This gave me, too, my excuse
for waiting there, when one of the attendants slipped
up to me and looked inquiringly down at me in my correct,
outdoor black things.</p>

<p>"I am to wait," I said, "for my mistress."</p>

<p>"Very good, Miss. Would you like a chair in the
ladies' cloak-room?"</p>

<p>"No. I don't think she will be very long, thank
you," I said. And I heard Mr. Brace, behind me, saying
in his embarrassed, stiff, young voice: "I am waiting
with this lady."</p>

<p>(The commissionaires and people must have thought
that the little, chestnut-haired lady's-maid in black had
got hold of a most superior sort of young man!)</p>

<p>I stepped farther up the vestibule towards a long
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;144]</span>
door with a bevelled, oval, glass-panelled top. Evidently
the door of the supper-room. From beyond it
came the muffled crash and lilt of dance music that set
my own foot tapping in time on the smooth floor. I
looked through the glass panel that framed, as it were,
the gayest of coloured moving pictures.</p>

<p>The big room was a sort of papier-maché Alhambra;
all zigzaggy arches and gilded columns and decorations,
towering above a spread of supper-tables. Silver
and white napery were blushing to pink under the glow
of rosy-shaded electric candles innumerable. Some
chairs were turned up, waiting for parties. But there
were plenty of people there already; a flower-bed of
frocks, made more bright by the black-and-white border
of the men's evening kit.</p>

<p>The ladies were all sitting on the wall seats; their
cavaliers sat with chairs slewed round, watching three
or four couples one-stepping among the tables to the
music of that string band, in cream-and-gold uniforms,
who were packed away in a Moorish niche at the top
of the room.</p>

<p>I got a burst of louder, madder music as a waiter
with a tray pushed through the swung door; a waft
of warmer air, made up of the smells of coffee, of cigarettes,
of hot food, and of those perfumes of which
you catch a whiff if you pass down the Burlington Arcade&mdash;oppoponax,
lilac, Russian violet, Phul-nana&mdash;all
blended together into one tepid, overpowering whole,
and, most penetrating, most unmistakable of all the
scents; the trèfle incarnat.... It reminded me that
Million would buy a great spray-bottle of mixed
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;145]</span>
bouquet, and had drenched herself with it, heedless of
my theory that a properly groomed woman needs very
little added perfume.</p>

<p>But where was Miss Million, in the middle of the
noise and feasting? Ah! There! I caught, in a cluster
of other colours&mdash;green, white, rose, and gold&mdash;the unmistakable
metaphorical shriek of the frock I'd begged
her not to wear. "Me cerise evening one." There it
was; and there were Million's sturdily built, rather
square little shoulders, and her glossy black hair that
I've learnt to do rather well. She was gazing about her
with jewel-bright eyes and a flush on her cheeks that
almost echoed the cherry-colour of her odious frock,
and listening to the chatter of the golden-haired, sulphur-crested
cockatoo, Vi Vassity; there she was; and
there was the Jew they called Leo, and Lady Golightly-Long
in a fantastic Oriental robe of sorts, and a cluster
of others. There, too, towering above them all as he
came steering his way across the room, and looking
more like a magazine illustration than ever in evening-dress,
was the Honourable James Burke.</p>

<p>I saw Million's mouth open widely to some lively
greeting as he came up; they were all laughing and
chattering together. But I didn't hear a word, of
course. All was blent into an indistinguishable hubbub
against the music. The loudest part of all seemed to be
at a table next to Miss Million and her new friends.
This other table was entertained by a vacuous young
man with an eyeglass, who looked as if he'd already
had quite as much Bubbley as was good for him. He
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;146]</span>
laughed incessantly; wrangling with the waiter, calling
to friends across the room.</p>

<p>As the Honourable Jim passed, this eyeglassed young
man signalled wildly to him, and took up a paper
"dart" into which he'd twisted his menu-card. He
flung it&mdash;and missed.</p>

<p>It stuck in the hair of one of the girls who was
dancing. And then there was a little gale of laughter
and protests and calls, and the eyeglassed young man
put two fingers in his mouth and whistled piercingly to
Mr. Burke, who strode over to him, laughing, and cuffed
him on the side of the head. Then they began a sort
of mock fight, and a waiter came up and whispered and
was pushed out of the way, and there was more laughter.</p>

<p>The attention of the room was caught by the two
skirmishing, ragging young men. They were for the
moment the centre of the whirl and swirl of colour and
noise and rowdy laughter.</p>

<p>"There you are, Miss Lovelace. You see the kind
of thing it is," said an austere voice behind me. I
turned from the gay picture to a gloomy one&mdash;the face
of Mr. Reginald Brace, more than ever that of a young
Puritan soldier&mdash;a Roundhead, in fact&mdash;left over from
the Reformation, and looking on at some feasting of
the courtiers of Charles II. So far, I hadn't see anything
very terrible in the giddy scene before us; it was
loud, it was rowdy, rather silly, perhaps, but quite amusing
(I thought) to watch!</p>

<p>Mr. Brace evidently took it quite differently.</p>

<p>He said: "Will this convince you? By Jove! how
disgusting." Mr. Burke had now got the other young
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;147]</span>
man down on the carpet. His glossily shod feet waved
wildly in the air. People from the tables farthest away
stood up to see what was happening. A slim American
flapper of sixteen, with the black hair-ribbons bobbing
behind her, skipped up on her chair to look. The Honourable
Jim Burke stepped back, showing his white
teeth in his cheeriest grin, and one of the other youths
at the table helped the eyeglassed one to struggle to
his feet.</p>

<p>"Who is that? Do you know?" I asked Mr. Brace.</p>

<p>He answered morosely: "Yes, I'm afraid I do. It
was with his introduction that that fellow Burke came
to me. That's Lord Fourcastles."</p>

<p>The noble lord seemed to have quite a fancy for
throwing things about&mdash;for first he made his table-napkin
into a rabbit and slung it at the waiter's head;
and then he picked up a "Serpentine" of gay tinsel,
and with a falsetto shout of "Play!" flung it across the
supper-room.</p>

<p>Somebody there seemed to have a stock of the things.
Lord Fourcastles was pelted back with them. Presently
the brilliant strings of colour were looped right
across food, and flowers, and diners in a gaudy, giant
web. I saw the Honourable Jim's merry face break
through it as he caught at a scarlet streamer and pretended
to use it as a lariat.</p>

<p>Then I saw him turn and take Lord Fourcastles by
the arm and draw him towards his own table. Evidently
he was going to introduce this young peer to Miss
Million.</p>

<p>I caught a glimpse of Million's excited little face,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;148]</span>
all aglow, turned towards the door through which I was
peeping. If I'd gone a step nearer she might have seen
me. I could have beckoned to her, made her come out
to see what the matter was. Then I could have insisted
that it was time for her to come home, or something ...
something!</p>

<p>I believe I might have made her come!</p>

<p>Oh, why didn't I try to do this?</p>

<p>Why, why didn't I do it before it was too late?</p>

<p>As the two neighbouring supper parties amalgamated
into one the fun seemed to get even more fast
and furious.</p>

<p>It was deafeningly noisy now. And still the noise
was rising as more guests came in. People flung themselves
about in their chairs; the dancing became, if anything,
more of a romp than before.</p>

<p>I had a glimpse of the eyeglassed, young Lord Fourcastles
stretching over the table to grab some pink
flowers out of a silver bowl. He began sticking them
in Miss Million's hair; I saw her toss her little dark
head back, giggling wildly; I could imagine the shrill
"Ows" and "Give overs" that were coming out of her
pink "O" of a mouth.</p>

<p>Then I saw Mr. Burke spring up from his chair
again, and put his arm round Miss Vi Vassity's waist,
dragging "London's Love" round the tables in a mad
prance that I suppose was intended for a one-step, she
laughing so much that she could neither dance nor stand
still, and giving a generous display of high-heeled,
gilt cothurne and of old-gold silk stocking as she was
steered and whirled along.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;149]</span>
"Stand away from the door, there, Miss. Stand
away, please," said one of the hurrying waiters. And
I stood away, followed by my grave-faced escort, Mr.
Brace. We retired further down the vestibule, among
the little knot of attendants and of waiting chauffeurs.</p>

<p>"Have you seen enough of it, Miss Lovelace?" asked
Mr. Brace.</p>

<p>"I think so," I said. I was feeling suddenly rather
tired, bored by the noise, dazzled by the blaze of pink
lights and the whirl of colour. "I don't think I'll wait
for Miss Million after all. I'll go home." I meant to
think over the talking-to that I should give Million
when she returned.</p>

<p>"I'll get you a taxi," began Mr. Brace. But I
stopped him.</p>

<p>"I don't want a taxi, thanks&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Please. I want to see you home."</p>

<p>"Oh! But I don't want you to," I said hastily.
"I'll get the 'bus. It's such a short way. Good-night."</p>

<p>But he wouldn't say "Good-night." He insisted on
boarding the 'bus with me, and plumping himself down
on the front seat beside me, under the fine drizzle that
was still coming down.</p>

<p>Certainly it was only a short 'bus ride to the Strand,
but a good deal happened in it. In fact, that happened
which is supposed to mark an unforgettable epoch in a
girl's life&mdash;her first proposal of marriage.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_150" id="Pg_150">[Pg&nbsp;150]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<h3>MY FIRST PROPOSAL</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">We</span> were alone on the top of the 'bus.</p>

<p>Mr. Brace turned to me, settling the oil-cloth 'bus
apron over my knees as if I were a very small and
helpless child that must be taken great care of.</p>

<p>Then he said: "You didn't like it, did you? All
that?" with a jerk of his head towards the side street
from which the 'bus was lurching away.</p>

<p>I said: "Well! I don't think there seemed to be
any real harm in that sort of frivolling. It's very expensive,
though, I suppose&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Very," said Mr. Brace grimly.</p>

<p>"But, of course, Miss Million has plenty of money
to waste. Still, it's rather silly&mdash;a lot of grown-up
people behaving like that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here I had another mental glimpse of Mr. Burke's
reckless, merry, well-bred face, bending over Miss Vi
Vassity's common, good-humoured one, with its shrewd,
black eyes, its characteristic flash of prominent white
teeth; I saw his tall, supple figure whirling round her
rather squat, overdressed little shape in that one-step.</p>

<p>"'Larking' about with all sorts of people they
wouldn't otherwise meet, I suppose, and shrieking and
'ragging' like a lot of costers on Hampstead Heath.
Yes. Really it was rather like a very much more expensive
Bank Holiday crowd. It was only another
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;151]</span>
way of dancing to organs in the street, and of flourishing
'tiddlers,' and of shrieking in swing-boats, and of
changing hats. Only all that seems to 'go' with costers.
And it doesn't with these people," I said, thinking
of Mr. Burke's clean-limbed, public-school, hunting-field look.</p>

<p>"I shall tell Mill&mdash;Miss Million that. And she won't
like it," I chattered on, as Mr. Brace didn't seem to be
going to say anything more. "I really think she's better
away from those places, perhaps, after all.</p>

<p>"Late hours won't suit her, I know. Why, she's
never been out of bed after half-past ten before in
her whole life. And she's never tasted those weird
things they were having for supper; hot dressed crab
and pastry with mushrooms inside it! As for champagne&mdash;well,
I expect she'll have a horrid headache to-morrow.
I shall have to give her breakfast in bed and
look after her like a moth&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Miss Lovelace! You must do nothing of the sort.
That sort of thing must stop," the young man at my
side blurted out. "You oughtn't to be doing that.
It's too preposterous&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>This was the second time to-day I'd heard that
word applied to my working as Miss Million's maid.
The first time the Honourable Jim Burke had said it.
Now here was a young man who disagreed with the
Honourable Jim on every other point, apparently working
himself up into angry excitement over this.</p>

<p>"That you&mdash;you&mdash;should be Miss Million's maid.
Good heavens! It's unthinkable!"</p>

<p>"I suppose you mean," I said rather maliciously,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;152]</span>
"that you couldn't think of that sister of yours doing
anything of the kind."</p>

<p>He didn't seem to hear me. He said quite violently:
"You must give it up. You must give it up at once."</p>

<p>I laughed a little. I said: "Give up a good, well-paid
and amusing situation? Why? And what could
I do instead? Go back to my aunt, I suppose&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No," broke in the young bank manager, still quite
violently, "come to me, couldn't you?"</p>

<p>I was so utterly taken aback that I hadn't a word
to reply. I thought I must have misunderstood what
he said.</p>

<p>There was a moment of jolting silence.</p>

<p>Then, in a tone of voice that seemed as if it had
been jerked out of him, sentence by sentence, with the
rolling of the 'bus, Mr. Brace went on:</p>

<p>"Miss Lovelace! I don't know whether you knew it,
but&mdash;I have always&mdash;if you only knew the enormous
admiration, the reverence, that I have always had for
you&mdash;I ought not to have said it so soon, I suppose.
I meant not to have said it for some time yet. But if
you could possibly&mdash;there is nothing that I would not
do to try to make you happy, if you would consent to
become my wife."</p>

<p>"Oh, good heavens!" I exclaimed, absolutely dazed.</p>

<p>"I know," said young Mr. Brace rather hoarsely,
"that it is fearful presumption on my part. I know
I haven't got anything much to offer a girl like
you."</p>

<p>"Oh," I said, coming out of my first shock of surprise,
"oh, but I'm sure you have." I felt quite a lump
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;153]</span>
in my throat. I was so touched at the young man's
modesty. I said again: "Oh, but I'm sure you have,
Mr. Brace. Heaps!"</p>

<p>And I looked at his face in the light of the street
lamp past which the 'bus was swinging. That radiance
and the haze of lamp-lit raindrops made a sort of
"glory" about him. He has a nice face, one can't
deny it. A fair, frank, straight, conscientious, young
face. So typically the best type of honourable, reliable,
average young Englishman. Such a contrast to the
wary, subtle, dare-devil Celtic face, with the laughing,
mocking eyes of Mr. Jim Burke, for example.</p>

<p>The next thing I knew was that Mr. Brace had got
hold of my hand and was holding it most uncomfortably
tight.</p>

<p>"Then, could you?" he said in that strained voice.
"Do you mean you could make me so tremendously
proud and happy?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no! I'm afraid not," I said hastily. "I
couldn't!"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't say that," he put in anxiously. "Miss
Lovelace! If you only knew! I am devoted to you.
Nobody could be more so. If you could only try to
care for me. Of course, I see this must seem very
abrupt."</p>

<p>"Oh, not at all," I put in hastily again. I did hate
not to seem kind and nice to him, after he'd said he was
devoted, even though it did sound&mdash;well&mdash;do I mean
"stilted"? The next thing he said was also rather
stilted and embarrassing.</p>

<p>"But ever since I first saw you in Putney I knew
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;154]</span>
the truth. You are the one girl in the world for
me!"</p>

<p>"Oh, no! There must be such crowds of them," I
assured him. "Really pretty ones; much nicer than me.
I'm sure I'm not one bit as nice as you think me....
Oh, heavens&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>For here a wild jolt from the motor-'bus had nearly
pitched me into his arms. The top of the 'bus is absolutely
the worst place in the world to listen to a
proposal, unless you're absolutely certain of accepting
the young man. Even so it must have its drawbacks.</p>

<p>"I'm sure," I said, "that I should be bad-tempered,
horrid to live with&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Miss Lovelace&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And here's the Cecil. I must get off here," I said
with some relief. "Good-night. No! Please don't
get off with me. I'd so much rather you didn't."</p>

<p>"May I see you again, then? Soon?" he persisted,
standing up on that horrible 'bus that rocked like a
boat at anchor in a rough sea. "To-morrow?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;no, not to-morrow&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, to-morrow. I have so much to say to you.
I must call. I'll write&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Good-night!" I called back ruefully.</p>

<p>And feeling aghast and amused and a little elated all
at once, Miss Million's maid, who had just had an offer
of marriage from the manager of Miss Million's bank,
entered Miss Million's hotel, and went upstairs to Miss
Million's rooms to wait until her mistress came back
from the Thousand and One.</p>

<p>When I had taken off my wet outdoor things and
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;155]</span>
reassumed my cap and apron, I sat down on Miss Million's
plump pink couch, stuffed one downy cushion
into the curve of my back, another into the nape of my
neck, put my slippered feet up on a <i>pouffe</i>, and prepared
to wait up for her, dozing, perhaps....</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<h3>WAITING FOR THE REVELLER</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">It</span> was a very deep doze into which I sank. I roused
myself with a start as the little gilt clock on the mantel-piece
chimed four.</p>

<p>I sprang up. Had Miss Million come in without
waking me?</p>

<p>I tapped at the door of her bedroom. No reply.</p>

<p>I went softly in, switching on the lights. There was
no one there. All was in the apple-pie order in which
I had left her pretty, luxurious room.</p>

<p>She hadn't come in? At four o'clock? Wondering
and troubled, I went back to the couch and dozed
again.</p>

<p>It was five o'clock when next I woke. Dawn struggled
through the chinks of the blinds.</p>

<p>No Million.</p>

<p>I waited, and waited.</p>

<p>Six o'clock in the morning. I threw aside the curtains....
Bright daylight now. Still no Million!</p>

<p>Seven o'clock, and the cheery sounds of morning
activity all around me.</p>

<p>But Million hadn't come in.</p>

<p>Out all night?</p>

<p>What could be the meaning of it?</p>

<p>From eight to nine-thirty this morning I have spent
sitting at the telephone in my mistress's room; feverishly
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;157]</span>
fluttering the leaves of the thick red telephone
book, and calling up the numbers of people who I have
imagined might know what has become of Miss Million,
the heiress, and why she has not come home.</p>

<p>I turned up first of all her hostess at the Supper
Club. "London's Love," she may be; but certainly not
my love. It was she who asked Million to that horrible
party.</p>

<p>"Give me 123 Playfair, please.... Is that Miss Vi
Vassity?... Can I speak to Miss Vi Vassity, please?
It is something urgent&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>A pert and Cockney voice squeaked into my ear that
Miss Vi Vassity wasn't at home. That nobody knew
when she was coming back. That the time to expect her
was the time when she was seen coming in!</p>

<p>Charming trait! But why did the comedienne with
the brass-bright hair choose to pass on that characteristic
to my mistress?</p>

<p>I tried another number. "Nought, nought, nought
Gerrard, please. I want to speak to Mr. Burke."</p>

<p>A rich brogue floated back to me across the wires.
"What's attached to the charmin' girlish voice that's
delighting my ears?"</p>

<p>"This is Miss&mdash;Miss Million's maid."</p>

<p>"Go on, darlin'," said the voice.</p>

<p>I gasped.</p>

<p>"Is that Mr. Burke speaking?"</p>

<p>"Who should ut be? This is the great, the notorious
Burke himself."</p>

<p>"I mean," I called flurriedly, "is that my Mr.
Burke?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;158]</span>
"I'd ask to be called nothing better!" declared
the voice. "Thry me!"</p>

<p>I raged, flushing scarlet, and thanking heaven that
those irrepressible blue Irish eyes did not see my angry
confusion.</p>

<p>I called back: "This is important, Mr. Burke. I
want to ask you about my mistress. Miss Million has
not come back, and I want you to tell me if you know
where she has gone."</p>

<p>"Is there anything I'd refuse a young lady? I'd
tell you in one minute if I knew, me dear."</p>

<p>"You don't know?" anxiously. "Where did you
last see her?"</p>

<p>"Isn't it my own black and bitter loss that I'll confide
to ye now? Miss Million, d'ye say? Faith, I've
never seen her at all!"</p>

<p>"Not last night&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not anny night. Can't I come round and dhry
those tears for her pretty maid?" demanded the voice
that I now heard to be Irish with a difference from the
softly persuasive accent of the Honourable Jim.</p>

<p>It went on: "Sure, I can see from here the lovely
gyrull you must be, from your attractive voice!
Where'r' ye speakin' from? Will I call on ye this
afternoon, or will ye come round to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>I broke in with severity:</p>

<p>"Do you mind telling me your other name?"</p>

<p>"Christian names already? With all the pleasure
in life, dear," came back the eager answer. "Here's
a health to those that love me, and me name's Julian!"</p>

<p>With another gasp I hung up the receiver, cutting
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;159]</span>
off this other, this unknown "J. Burke," whom I had
evoked in my flurry and the anxiety that caused the
addresses in the telephone book to dance before my
eyes.</p>

<p>I got the number of the Honourable James Burke,
and found myself speaking, I suppose, to somebody in
the Jermyn Street hairdresser's shop, above which, as
I'd heard from Mr. Brace, the Honourable Jim lived in
a single room.</p>

<p>"No, Madam, I am afraid he is not in," was the
answer here. "I am afraid I couldn't tell you, Madam.
I don't know at all. Will you leave any message?"</p>

<p>"No, thank you."</p>

<p>It didn't seem worth while, for, as Mr. Brace said,
he's never there. He's always to be found in some
expensive haunt.</p>

<p>Next I rang up the abode in Mount Street of the
cobra-woman, the classic dancer, Lady Golightly-Long.
Her maid informed me, rebukefully, that her ladyship
wasn't up yet; her ladyship wasn't awake. I left a
message, and the maid will ring me up here....
There may be something to hope for from that, but
I shall have to wait. I seem to have waited years!</p>

<p>Now, in desperation, I have got on to Lord Fourcastles's
house.</p>

<p>"No; his lordship has not been at home for several
days."</p>

<p>I suppose this is the man speaking.</p>

<p>"No. I couldn't say where his lordship is likely to
be found, I'm sure."</p>

<p>Oh, these people! These friends of the Honourable
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;160]</span>
Jim's, who all seem to share his habit of melting
into some landscape where they are not to be found!
Never mind any of them, though. The question is,
Miss Million! Where have they put her, among them?
What have they done with my child-heiress of a mistress?</p>

<p>I had hoped to receive some explanation of the mystery
by this morning's post. Nothing! Nothing but
a sheaf of circulars and advertisements and catalogues
for Miss Million, and one grey note for Miss Million's
maid. It was addressed to "Miss Smith."</p>

<p>I sighed, half-resentfully, as I tore it open. Under
any other circumstances it would have marked such a
red-letter day in my life.</p>

<p>I knew what it was. The first love-letter I had ever
received. Of course, from Mr. Reginald Brace. He
writes from what used to be "Next Door," in Putney,
S.W. He says:</p>

<p class="blockquot1"><span class="smcap">My Dear Miss Lovelace</span>:&mdash;I wanted to put 'Beatrice,'
since I know that is your beautiful name, but
I did not wish to offend you. I am afraid that I was
much too precipitate to-night when I told you of the
feeling I have had for you ever since I first saw you.
As I told you, I know this is the greatest presumption
on my part. Had it not been for the very exceptional
circumstances I should not have ventured to say anything
at all&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Oh, dear! I wish this didn't remind me of the Honourable
Jim's remark, "Curious idea, to put in a deaf-and-dumb
chap as manager of a bank!" For he is
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;161]</span>
really so good and straight and frank. I call this such
a nice letter. Oh, dear, what am I to say to it?</p>

<p class="blockquot1">"But as it is" (he goes on) "I could do nothing but
take my chance and beg you to consider if you could
possibly care for me a little. May I say that I adore
you, and that the rest of my life should be given up to
doing anything in the world to secure your happiness?
Had I a sister&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Good heavens! His non-existent sister is cropping
up again!</p>

<p class="blockquot1">"Had I a sister or a mother living, they would come
over at once to wait on you; but I am a man literally
alone in the world. I live with an old uncle who is
practically an invalid. I hope you will not mind my
calling upon you to-morrow, about lunch-time, when I
hope so much that you in your sweetness and kindness
may find it in your heart to give me another answer to
the one I had to hear to-night.</p>

<p class="blockquotc">"Yours ever devotedly,</p>

<p class="blockquotr">"<span class="smcap">Reginald Brace</span>."</p>

<p>Yes! A charming letter, I call it. I do, indeed.
And he&mdash;the writer of it&mdash;is charming&mdash;that is, he's
good, and "white," as men call it, which is so much
more, so much better than being "charming," which, I
suppose, people can't help, any more than they can
help having corncockle-blue eyes with black lashes&mdash;or
whatever kind of eyes they may happen to possess.</p>

<p>Mr. Brace's own eyes are very pleasant. So honest.
It was horrid of me to be ruffled and snappy to him
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;162]</span>
when he came last night; cattish of me to begin thinking
of him as a Puritan and a prude and a prig. He's
nothing of the sort. It was only kind of him to come
and try to warn me.</p>

<p>And, as it turns out, Mr. Brace was perfectly right
about all these people being no fit companions for a
young and inexperienced girl....</p>

<p>Which reminds me! Only a few days ago I was
considering this Mr. Brace as a possible suitor for
Million herself! Why, I'd quite forgotten that. And
now here he is lavishing offers of a life's devotion upon
me, Miss Million's maid.</p>

<p>I suppose I ought to be fearfully flattered. There's
something in Shakespeare about going down on one's
knees and thanking Heaven fasting for a good man's
love. (I'm sure he is that.) And so I should be feeling
most frightfully pleased and proud, if only I'd
time!</p>

<p>This morning I can think of nothing. Not even of
my first proposal and love-letter. Only of Miss Million,
whom I last saw at half-past eleven or so last night,
sitting in her "cerise evenin'&mdash;one with the spangles"&mdash;at
a Thousand-and-One supper-table, with a crowd of
rowdy people, and having pink flowers stuck in her
hair by an over-excited-looking young man!</p>

<p>Million, of whom I can find no further trace! Now,
what is the next&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Prrrring-g!"</p>

<p>Ah, the telephone bell again. The message from
Lady Golightly-Long.</p>

<p>She is speaking herself, in a deep, drawly voice. She
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;163]</span>
tells me that she knows nothing of Miss Million's movements.</p>

<p>"I left her there. I left them all there, at the Thousand
and One," she drawls. "I was the first to leave.
Miss Million was there, with Lord Fourcastles and the
rest of them when I left.... What?... The time?
Oh, I never know times. It wasn't very late. Early,
I mean. I left her there."</p>

<p>And she rings off. So that's drawn a blank. Well,
now what am I to do next?</p>

<p>I think I'd better go round to the club itself and
make inquiries there about the missing heiress!</p>

<p>I have just come back from making inquiries at the
Thousand and One Club.</p>

<p>The place looked strangely tawdry and make-believe
this morning. Rather like ballroom finery of the night
before, seen in daylight. I interviewed a sallow-faced
attendant in the vestibule, whence I had got those
glimpses of the larking and frolicking in the supper-room
last night.</p>

<p>Miss Million? He didn't know anything about a lady
of that name. With Miss Vi Vassity's party, had she
been? Miss Vi Vassity always had a rare lot of friends
with her. He'd seen her, of course, Miss Vi Vassity,
all right. Several young ladies with her.</p>

<p>"But a small, dark-haired young lady, in a bright
cerise dress, with spangles on it?" I urged. "She was
sitting&mdash;I'll show you her place at the table. There!
Don't you remember?"</p>

<p>The sallow-faced attendant couldn't say he did.
There was always a rare lot of bright-coloured frocks
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;164]</span>
about. He beckoned to a waiter, who came up, glancing
at me almost suspiciously out of his sunken eyes.</p>

<p>"Young lady in a bright, cherry-coloured frock, sitting
at Miss Vi Vassity's table? Yes! Now he came
to go back in his mind, he had seemed to notice the
young lady. She'd seemed a bit out of it at first.
Would that be the one?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," eagerly from me. "That would probably
be Miss Million!"</p>

<p>"Afterwards," said the waiter, "she seemed to be
having a good deal o' conversation with that young
Lord Fo'castles, as they call him."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes," I said, thinking again of the glimpse
I'd had of the rowdy, foolish-faced young man with
the eyeglass, who had been grabbing pink flowers off
the table and therewith scufflingly decorating Million's
little dark head.</p>

<p>"Laughing and talking together all the time they
was afterwards," said the waiter, in his suspicious,
weary voice. "I rec'lect the young pers&mdash;the young
lady, now. You called to wait for her, didn't you, Miss?
You and a fair gent. Last night. Then you left before
she come away."</p>

<p>"When? When did she go?" I demanded quickly.</p>

<p>"About an hour after you did, I should say."</p>

<p>"And who with?" I asked again breathlessly.
"Who was Miss Million with when she left this place?"</p>

<p>"Ar!" said the waiter, "now you're arskin'!" He
spoke more suspiciously than ever. And he looked
sharply at me, with such disfavour that I felt quite
guilty&mdash;though why, I don't know.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;165]</span>
Of what should he suspect me? I am sure I looked
nothing but what I was, a superior lady's-maid, well
turned out in all-black; rather pale from my last night's
vigil, and genuinely anxious because I could not find out
what had become of my mistress.</p>

<p>"Want to know a lot, some of you," said the waiter,
quite unpleasantly this time.</p>

<p>And he turned away. He left me, feeling snubbed
to about six inches shorter, standing, hesitating, on the
red carpet of the corridor.</p>

<p>Horrid man!</p>

<p>The attendant came up.</p>

<p>"Miss! About that young lady of yours," he began,
in a low, confidential voice.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes? Yes? You remember her now? You'll
tell me who she went away with?" I said quite desperately.
"Do tell me!"</p>

<p>"Well, I couldn't say for certain, of course; but&mdash;since
Alfred there was telling you she was talking a lot
with that young Lord Fourcastles, well! I see him go
off in the small car, and there was a lady with him," the
attendant told me. "That I did see. A young lady in
some sort of a wrap&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, but what sort of a wrap?" I cried impatiently.</p>

<p>Oh, the incomprehensible blindness of the Masculine
Eye! Woman dresses to please it. She spends the
third of her means, the half of her time, and the whole
of her thought on that object alone. And what is her
reward? Man&mdash;whether he's the restaurant attendant
or the creature who's taken her out to dinner&mdash;merely
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;166]</span>
announces: "I really couldn't say what sort of a wrap
she had on."</p>

<p>"Was it a white one? At least you'll remember
that?" I urged. I saw before my mind's eye Million's
restaurant coat of soft, creamy cloth, with the mother-o'-pearl
satin lining. How little I'd dreamt, as I put it
about my mistress's shoulders last night, that I should
be trying to trace its whereabouts&mdash;and hers&mdash;at
eleven o'clock this morning!</p>

<p>"Was it a light coat or a dark one that the lady had
on who drove away with Lord Fourcastles? You can
at least tell me that!"</p>

<p>The sallow-faced attendant shook his head.</p>

<p>Afraid he "hadn't thought to notice whether the
young lady's coat was white or black or what colour."</p>

<p>Blind Bat!</p>

<p>And as I turned away in despair I caught an amused
grin on his sallow face under the peaked cap, and I
heard him whistle through his teeth a stave of the
music-hall song, "Who Were You With Last
Night?"</p>

<p>Horrid, horrid man!</p>

<p>It seems to me this morning that all men are perfectly
horrid.</p>

<p>What about this young Lord Fourcastles?</p>

<p>That's the thought that's worrying me now as I walk
up and down Miss Million's deserted sitting-room, unable
to settle to anything; waiting, waiting....</p>

<p>Yes, what about that eyeglassed, rowdy, fair-faced
boy who was sticking flowers in her hair the last time
I saw her? Was it she who drove away from the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;167]</span>
Thousand and One Club in his car? Was it? And
where to?</p>

<p>Can he&mdash;&mdash;Awful thought! Can he possibly have
kidnapped Miss Million? Run away with her? Abducted
her?</p>

<p>After all, he must know she's an heiress&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Pooh! Absurd thought! This isn't the eighteenth
century. People don't abduct heiresses any more.
Million is all right&mdash;somewhere.</p>

<p>She's gone on with one of these people. They've
made what they call "a night" of it, and they're having
breakfast at Greenwich, or somewhere in the
country. Yes, but why didn't my mistress wire or telephone
from wherever she is to let her maid know?</p>

<p>Surely she'll want other clothes taken to her? I
see visions of her still in that low-cut, cerise frock,
with the June sunlight glinting on the spangles of it;
her creamy restaurant coat still fastened about her
sturdy bare shoulders, the wilting pink carnations still
in her hair. How hideously uncomfortable for her, poor
little thing....</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<h3>WHERE IS SHE?</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">At</span> mid-day! Where is she? What have they done
with her? And who are "they"?</p>

<p>Is it an idiotic joke on the part of that noisy, irrepressible
Lord Fourcastles? Is it for some bet that he
has spirited the little heiress away? Is it perhaps some
bit of absurd skylarking got up between himself and
the Honourable Jim?</p>

<p>If there's a chance of this it mustn't go further. I
shall have to keep my mouth shut.</p>

<p>I can't go applying to the police&mdash;and then having
Miss Million turning up and looking more than foolish!
Then scolding her maid for being such a fool!</p>

<p>That stops my telling anybody else about my fearful
anxiety&mdash;the mess I'm in!</p>

<p>Oh! Won't I tell Million what I think of her and
her friends&mdash;all of them, Fourcastles, the cobra-woman,
"London's Love," the giggling theatrical girls, and that
unscrupulous nouveau-pauvre pirate, the Honourable
Jim&mdash;as soon as she does condescend to reappear!...</p>

<p>A tap at the door. I fly to open it....</p>

<p>Only one of those little chocolate-liveried London
sparrows, the Cecil page-boys.</p>

<p>He has a large parcel for Miss Million. From
Madame Ellen's. (Oh, yes, of course. The blush-rose
pink that had to be let out.) Carriage forward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;169]</span>
"Please have it paid and charge it to Miss Million's
account," says Miss Million's maid, with great outward
composure and an inward tremor.</p>

<p>I've no money. Three-and-six, to be exact. Everything
she has is locked up. What&mdash;what am I to do
about the bills if she stays away like this?</p>

<p>She seems to have been away a century. Yet it's
only half-past twelve now. In half an hour Mr. Brace
will be calling on me for an answer to his proposal of
marriage....</p>

<p>There's another complication!</p>

<p>Oh! Why is life like this? Long dull stretches of
nothing at all happening for years and years. Then,
quite suddenly, "a crowded hour" of&mdash;No! Not
"glorious life" exactly. But one disturbing thing happening
on the top of another, until&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ppppring!"</p>

<p>Ah, the telephone again. Perhaps this is some news.
The cobra-lady may have heard where Miss Million
went.... "Yes?"</p>

<p>It wasn't the cobra-lady.</p>

<p>It was the rich, untrustworthy accent of the Honourable
James Burke.</p>

<p>Ah! At last! At last! Now, I thought, I should
hear something; some hint of Miss Million's whereabouts.</p>

<p>"Yes?" I called eagerly.</p>

<p>"Yes! I know who that is," called the voice&mdash;how
different, now that I heard it again, from that of the
Mr. J. Burke I rang up earlier, by mistake. "That's
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;170]</span>
the pearl of all ladies'-maids, isn't it? Good morning,
Miss Lovelace-Smith!"</p>

<p>"Good morning, Mr. Burke," I called back grudgingly.
Aggravating young man! How was I to find
out what I wanted to know without possibly giving my
mistress away?</p>

<p>Perhaps he had been sent to ring me up to bring
Miss Million's things to&mdash;wherever the party of them
were. I began: "Can I do anything for you&mdash;sir?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. Call me that again!"</p>

<p>"What?" snappishly.</p>

<p>"Call me 'sir' again, just like that," pleaded the
Honourable and Exasperating Jim. "I never heard
any pet name sound so pretty!"</p>

<p>I shook my head furiously at the receiver.</p>

<p>Teasing me like this, when I was deadly serious, and
so anxious to get sense out of him for once! Tormenting
me from "under cover" of a telephone that didn't
allow me to see his face or to know where he was.</p>

<p>I said angrily: "Where are you speaking from?"</p>

<p>"I've paid&mdash;I mean I've had to get a trunk-call for
these few minutes, so don't let them be spent in squabbling,
child," said Mr. Burke sweetly. "I'm in
Brighton."</p>

<p>"Brighton&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Ah! They were all down there probably. That was
it! He'd whisked them away on his coach&mdash;on Leo
Rosencranz's coach&mdash;just as he'd said he would! At
last I'd know&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Brighton's looking fine this morning," took up the
easy, teasing voice. "Let me take you down here for a
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;171]</span>
glimpse of the waves and the downs on your next afternoon
out, Miss Maid. Say you will? You've no engagement?"</p>

<p>I began, quite savagely: "Yes, I've&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mr. Brace!" announced one of the chocolate-liveried
page-boys at the door.</p>

<p>Quickly I turned. And in my silly flurry I was
idiotic enough to hang up the receiver again!</p>

<p>Horrors!</p>

<p>That's done it! I've rung off before I've been able
to ask that villain, the Honourable Jim, where I am
to ring him up, or ring any of them up, in Brighton!</p>

<p>They may be anywhere there! I've missed my chance
of getting them!</p>

<p>Yes; that's done it....</p>

<p>Meanwhile here's this young man who proposed to
me on the top of the 'bus last night coming in for his
answer!</p>

<p>In he came, looking rather tense and nervous.</p>

<p>But after all my adventures of this morning what a
relief it was to me to see a friend; a man who wasn't
a suspicious waiter or an attendant who stared, or a
teasing incorrigible who exasperated me from the other
side of a telephone!</p>

<p>I don't think I've ever been so glad to see anybody
as I was to see Mr. Brace again!</p>

<p>I said "Good morning" most welcomingly. And
then I was sorry.</p>

<p>For he caught me by both hands and looked down
into my face, while his own lighted up into the most
indescribable joy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;172]</span>
"Beatrice!" he exclaimed. "It's 'Yes,' then? Oh,
my dar&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, please don't, please don't!" I besought him,
snatching my hands away in sudden horror. "I didn't
mean that. It isn't 'Yes'&mdash;&mdash;" He took a step back,
and all the light went out of his face.</p>

<p>Very quietly he said: "It's 'No'?"</p>

<p>I hate being "rushed." It seems to me everybody
tries to rush me. I hate having to give answers on
the spur of the moment!</p>

<p>I said: "I don't know what it is! I haven't been
thinking about what you said!"</p>

<p>That seemed rather an ungracious thing to say to a
man who had just offered one the devotion of his whole
life. So I added what was the honest truth: "I haven't
had time to think about it!"</p>

<p>A scowl came over Mr. Brace's fair face. He said in
tones of real indignation: "You're as pale as a little
ghost this morning. You've been working too hard.
You've been running yourself off your feet for that
wretched little&mdash;for that mistress of yours!"</p>

<p>So true, in one way!</p>

<p>"It's got to stop," said Mr. Reginald Brace firmly.
"I won't have you slaving like this. I'm going to take
you away out of it all. I'm going to tell Miss Million
so now."</p>

<p>"You can't," I said hastily.</p>

<p>"Why? Isn't she up?" (disgustedly).</p>

<p>"Y&mdash;yes, I think so. I mean yes, of course. Only
just now she's out."</p>

<p>"When will she be in, Miss Lovelace?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;173]</span>
"I don't know in the very least," I said with perfect
truth. "I haven't the slightest idea." But I
realised that I had better keep any further details of
my mistress's absence to myself.</p>

<p>"There you are, you see. She treats you abominably.
A girl like you!" declared the young bank manager
wrathfully. "Works you to death, and then goes
off to enjoy herself, without even letting you know how
long you may expect to have to yourself! Shameful!
But, look here, Miss Lovelace, you must leave her. You
must marry me. I tell you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>And what he told me was just what he'd told me
the night before, over and over again, about his adoration,
his presumption, his leaving nothing in the world
undone that could make me happy.... And so on,
and so forth. All the things a girl loves to hear. Or
would love&mdash;provided she weren't distracted, as I
was, by having something else on her mind the whole
time!</p>

<p>I am afraid my answers were fearfully "absent."</p>

<p>Thus:</p>

<p>"No! Of course, I don't find you 'distasteful.' Why
should I?" Then to myself: "I wonder if Mr. Burke
may ring me up again presently?"</p>

<p>And:</p>

<p>"No! Of course there isn't anybody else that I
care for. I've never seen anybody else!" And again,
aside: "How would it be if I rang up every hotel in
Brighton, one after the other, until I came to one that
knew something about Mr. Burke's party?"</p>

<p>I decided to do this.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;174]</span>
Then I began to fume impatiently. If only this nice,
kind, delightful young man would go and let me get to
the telephone!</p>

<p>But there he stood, urging his suit, telling me that
he was obliged to go off on business to Paris early that
afternoon; begging me to let him have his answer before
he had to leave me.</p>

<p>"How long shall you be in Paris?" I asked him.</p>

<p>"A week. Possibly longer. It's such a long, long
time&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It isn't a long time to give any woman to make
up her mind in," I told him desperately. I thought all
the time: "Supposing Million took it into her head to
stay wherever she is for a week without letting me
know? Horrors!"</p>

<p>I went on: "I can't tell you now whether I want
to marry you or not. Just at this moment I don't
feel I shall ever want to marry anybody! If you take
your answer now it'll have to be 'No'!"</p>

<p>So then, of course, he said that he would wait. He
would wait until he came back from Paris, hard as it
would be to bear. And then there were a lot more kind
and flattering things said about "a girl like me" and
"the one girl in the world," and all that kind of thing.
And then, at last&mdash;at last he went, kissing my hand and
saying that he would write and tell me directly he knew
when he was coming to see me again.</p>

<p>He went, and I turned to the telephone. But before
I had so much as unhooked the receiver the door of
Miss Million's sitting-room opened after a brief tap,
and there stood&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;175]</span>
Who but that Power in a frock-coat, the manager of
the hotel himself.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Miss," he said to me, with quite an
affable nod.</p>

<p>But his eyes, I noticed, were glancing at every detail
in the room, at the telephone book on the floor, at
the new novels and magazines on the table, at the flowers
and cushions, at the big carton from Madame Ellen's
that I had not yet taken into the bedroom, at me and
my tired face. "Your young lady, Miss Million, hasn't
returned yet, I understand?"</p>

<p>"No," I said, as lightly as I could. "Miss Million
is not yet back."</p>

<p>"Ah! Time off for you, then," said the manager
still very pleasantly. But I could not help thinking
that there was a look in his eye that reminded me of
that suspicious waiter at the club.</p>

<p>"Easy life, you young ladies have, it seems to me,"
said the manager. "Comfortable quarters here, have
you? That's right. How soon do you think that you
may be expecting your young lady back, Miss?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm not sure," said I very lightly, but with a
curious sinking at my heart. What was the meaning
of the manager's visit? Was he only just looking in
to pass the time of day with the maid of one of his
patrons? Or&mdash;horrible thought!&mdash;did he imagine that
there was something not quite usual about Miss Million?</p>

<p>Had he, too, wondered over our arriving at the hotel
with those old clothes and those new trunks? And now
was he keeping an eye on whatever Miss Million meant
to do? For all his pleasant manner, he did look as if
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;176]</span>
he thought something about her were distinctly
"fishy"!</p>

<p>I said brightly: "She may stay away for a few
days."</p>

<p>"A little change into the country, I expect? Do
anybody good this stuffy weather," said the affable
manager. "Going down to join her, I expect, aren't
you?"</p>

<p>This was a poser, but I answered, I think, naturally
enough. I said: "Well, I'm waiting to hear from her
first if she wants me!"</p>

<p>And I nodded quite cheerily at the manager as he
passed again down the corridor.</p>

<p>I trust he hadn't even a suspicion of the uneasy
anxiety that he had left behind him in the heart of
Miss Million's maid!</p>

<p>What a perfectly awful day this has been! Quite
the most awful that I've ever lived through in all my
twenty-three years of life!</p>

<p>I thought it was quite bad enough when all I had
to bear was the gnawing anxiety over Million's disappearance,
and the suspense of waiting, waiting, waiting
for news of her! Living for the sound of the telephone
bell ... sitting up here in her room, feeling as if
three years had elapsed between each of my lonely hotel
meals ... wondering, wondering over and over again
what in the world became of her since I saw my young
mistress at the Supper Club last night....</p>

<p>But now I've something worse to bear. Something
far more appalling has happened!</p>

<p>I felt a presentiment that something horrible and unforeseen
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;177]</span>
might occur, even before the first visit of the
manager, with his suspicious glance, to Miss Million's
room.</p>

<p>For I'd wandered downstairs, in my loneliness, to
talk to the girl in the telephone exchange.</p>

<p>She's a bright-eyed, chatty creature who sits there
all day under the big board with the lights that appear
and disappear like glowworms twinkling on a lawn.
She always seems to have a cup of tea and a plate of
toast at her elbow.</p>

<p>She also seems always to have five minutes for a chat.
And she's taken a sort of fancy to me; already she's
confided to me countless bits of information about the
staff and the people who are staying or who have
stayed in the hotel.</p>

<p>"The things I've seen since I've been working here
would fill a book," she told me blithely, when I drifted
in to find companionship in her little room.</p>

<p>"Really, I think that if I'd only got time to sit down
and write everything I'd come across in the way of the
strange stories, and the experiences, and the different
types of queer customers that one has come in one's
way, well! I'd make my fortune. Hall Caine couldn't
be in it. Excuse me a minute." (This was a telephone
interlude.)</p>

<p>"The people you'd never think had anything odd
about them," pursued the telephone girl, "and that turn
out to be the Absolute Limit!" (I wondered, uneasily,
if she thought that my absent mistress, Miss Million,
belonged to this particular type.)</p>

<p>So I went back to the subject next time I passed
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;178]</span>
the telephone office. (This was after the manager had
looked into my room with his kind inquiries after Miss
Million.)</p>

<p>"And, really," I said. I can't think what made me,
Beatrice Lovelace, feel as guilty as if I were a pickpocket
myself. Perhaps it was because I had something
to hide. Namely, the fact that I was a maid whose
mistress had left the hotel without a hint as to her
destination or the date of her return!</p>

<p>"That's a Scotland Yard man that's passing in the
hall now," she added, dropping her voice. "No; not
the one you're looking at," as I turned to glance at a
very broad, light-grey back. "That's another of our
American cousins. Just come. A friend of Mr. Isaac
Rattenheimer; have you seen Mrs. Rattenheimer when
she's going out in the evening? My dear! The woman
blazes with jewels like a Strand shooting-gallery with
lights. You really ought to have a look at her.</p>

<p>"Come down into the lounge to-night; pretend you've
got some note or something for your Miss Million.
She'll be coming back to-night, I suppose?" she said.</p>

<p>"Oh, she may not. It all depends," I said vaguely,
but with a desperate cheerfulness.</p>

<p>I left the telephone girl to decide for herself what
this mysterious thing might be that I had said "depended,"
and I drifted out again into the vestibule.</p>

<p>Here I passed the young man my friend had called
an American cousin. He looked very American. His
shoulders, which were broad enough in all conscience,
seemed padded at least two inches broader. And the cut
of his light-grey tweeds, and the shape of his shoes, and
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;179]</span>
the way he'd parted his sleek, thick, mouse-coloured hair,
were all unmistakably un-English.</p>

<p>As I passed he stared; not rudely, but with a kind
of boyish, naïve interest. I wondered what Miss Million
would have thought of him.</p>

<p>She's accustomed to giving me her impressions of
every fresh person she sees; talking over each detail
of their appearance while I'm doing her hair.... I
mean that's what she used to be accustomed to! If only
I knew when I should do her hair again!</p>

<p>Well, I walked upstairs, and the first hint of coming
discomfort met me on our landing. It took the shape
of our sandy-haired chamber-maid. She was whisking
down the corridor, looking flushed and highly indignant
over something or other. As I passed her she pulled
up for a moment and addressed me.</p>

<p>"Your turn next, Miss Smith, I suppose!" she
sniffed, with the air of one who feels that (like Job)
she does well to be angry. "You'd better be getting
ready for it!"</p>

<p>"Getting ready for what?" I asked bewilderedly.</p>

<p>But the sandy-haired one, with another little snort,
had passed on.</p>

<p>I think I heard her muttering something about
"Never had such a thing happen before! The ideear!"
as she disappeared down the corridor. I was puzzled
as I went back into Miss Million's room, that seems to
have been empty for so long. What did the chamber-maid
mean? What "thing" had happened? What was
I to prepare for? And it was my "turn" for what?</p>

<p>I was soon to know.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<h3>AN UNEXPECTED INVASION!</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">I had</span> scarcely been in the room ten minutes. I was
putting fresh water into the tall glass jar that held the
sheaf of red carnations, when there came yet another
tap at the white door that I have had to open several
times already to-day, but never to any messenger with
tidings of my missing mistress!</p>

<p>This time, to my amazement, it was quite a group
of men who asked for admittance to Miss Million's
room!</p>

<p>There was first the frock-coated manager; then a
very stout and black-eyed and fleshy-nosed Hebrew gentleman
whom I hadn't seen before; then a quiet-looking
man with a black tie whom I recognised as the one who
had been pointed out to me by the telephone girl as a
Scotland Yard plain-clothes detective; then the young
American in the light-grey tweeds.</p>

<p>I wondered if I were dreaming as this quartette proceeded
to walk calmly in.</p>

<p>Such an invasion!</p>

<p>What could they all want?</p>

<p>The manager turned to me with a smile. He spoke
in quite as pleasant a voice as he had spoken before;
it was, indeed, quite conciliating! But there was an
order behind it!</p>

<p>"Now, Miss Smith, I am very sorry to have to disturb
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;181]</span>
you. We're all very sorry, I'm sure," with a
glance at the other three men.</p>

<p>The detective looked polite and blank; the Jew man
seemed fussing and fuming over something; the young
American glanced interestedly about the room, taking
everything in, down to the carnations in my hand. He
smiled at me. He had a friendly face.</p>

<p>"Not at all," I said, wishing my heart would not
beat with such unreasonable alarm. "Is there anything&mdash;is
it anything about my mistress?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no. Miss Smith. It's a mere formality we're
asking you to submit to," said the manager. "All
our own staff have complied, without raising any objection.
And we think it advisable to apply the same
thing to other&mdash;er&mdash;to other people employed about
the place. It's as much for your own sake as for ours,
you know?"</p>

<p>"What is?" I asked, feeling distinctly more fluttered.</p>

<p>"I am sure you're far too reasonable to make any
demur," the manager went on soothingly. "The last
young lady, our Miss Mackenzie, raised no objection at
all."</p>

<p>Mackenzie is the sandy-haired chamber-maid.</p>

<p>"Objection to what?" I asked, with as much dignity
as I could possibly summon up.</p>

<p>"Why, to having us go through her boxes, Miss
Smith," said the manager with great suavity. "The
fact is an article of value is missing from this hotel.
The property of Mr. Rattenheimer here," with a turn
towards the obese Hebrew, "and it would be a satisfaction
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;182]</span>
to him and to all of us to prove that no suspicious
can be attached to anybody in the place. So&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>So that was it!</p>

<p>They wanted to search my things to see if I were a
thief!</p>

<p>Yes, they actually wanted to search my trunks!
Just as if I were a suspected servant in a country house
where one of the guests finds a diamond bar missing!</p>

<p>Here was a nice predicament for Aunt Anastasia's
niece, and for my poor father's child, to say nothing
of Lady Anastasia's great-granddaughter! It was so
absurd that I nearly laughed. At all events, I suppose
the anxious expression must have left my face for the
moment.</p>

<p>The manager rubbed his hands, and said in a pleased
voice: "Ah, I knew you were sensible, and would make
no fuss! When people have clear consciences I don't
suppose they mind who goes looking through their
things. I am sure I should not mind anybody in the
world knowing what was inside my boxes. Now, Miss
Smith, I think your room is No. 46, is it not? So if
you will be kind enough to give me your keys, and&mdash;&mdash;If
you would not mind stepping with us across the corridor&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here I found voice.</p>

<p>"You really mean it?" I said. "You want to search
my trunks?"</p>

<p>"Merely as a matter of form," repeated the manager
a little more insistently. "I am sure a young
lady like you would not mind who knew what was in her
trunks."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;183]</span>
I stood there, one hand still full of the red carnations
that I was rearranging, the other gripping the
end of the pink couch. I was thinking at lightning
speed even as the frock-coated, shrewd-eyed, suave-voiced
manager was speaking.</p>

<p>My trunks?</p>

<p>Well, as far as that went, I had only one trunk to
my name! For I had given Mackenzie, the sandy-haired
chamber-maid, all the luggage which had known
me in Putney.</p>

<p>When she asked me what she was to do with it, I
told her she could give it to the dustman to take away,
or cut it up for lighting the fires with, or anything she
liked. She had said, "Very good" in a wooden tone
that I knew masked surprise and wonderment unceasing
over the inhabitants of Nos. 44, 45, and 46. Consequently
I had, as I say, only one single trunk in the
whole wide world.</p>

<p>And that was the brand-new masterpiece of the
trunkmaker's art, bought in Bond Street, and handed
over to me for my use by Miss Million on the ill-fated
day when we first arrived at the Cecil.</p>

<p>As for what was in it&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Well, in one of Miss Million's own idioms, "It was
full of emptiness"!</p>

<p>There was not a thing in it but the incorporate
air and the expensive-smelling perfume of very good
new leather!</p>

<p>As the luggage of a modest lady's-maid it was really
too eccentric-looking to display to the suspicious eyes
of the four men who waited there in Miss Million's
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;184]</span>
sitting-room confronting me. I protested incoherently:
"Oh, I don't think I can let you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the stout Jewish gentleman, with a
vicious glance from me to the Scotland Yard detective,
"this don't seem a case of a very clear conscience!"</p>

<p>The manager put up a deprecating hand.</p>

<p>"A little quietly, sir, if you please. I am sure Miss
Smith will see that it is quite as much for her own benefit
to let us just give a bit of a look through her things."</p>

<p>Her "things!" There, again, was something rather
embarrassing. The fact was I had so ridiculously few
things. No dress at all but the well-cut, brand-new
gown that I stood up in; one hat, one jacket, and two
pairs of expensive shoes, three changes of underclothes,
and silk stockings. All were good, but all so obviously
just out of the shop! There was absolutely nothing
about them to link their owner to any past before she
came to the hotel!</p>

<p>For the fact is that when I sent my boxes and hold-all
away I had also repudiated every stitch of the very
shabby clothing that had been mine while I was not
Miss Million's maid, but her mistress. The ne'er-do-well
serge skirts, the makeshift "Jap" silk blouses with
no "cut" about them, the underclothes, all darned
and patched, the much-mended stockings, once black
cashmere but now faded to a kind of myrtle-green&mdash;all,
all had gone to swell two bulky parcels which I had put
up and sent off to The Little Sisters of the Poor!</p>

<p>I had heaved a sigh of delight as I had handed those
parcels over the post-office counter. It had been the
fulfilment of the wish of years!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;185]</span>
I expect every hard-up girl knows that impulse, that
mad longing that she could make a perfectly clean
sweep of every single stitch she possesses to wear! How
rapturously she would send it all, all away! Oh, her
joy if she might make an entirely new start&mdash;with all
fresh clothes; good ones, pretty ones, becoming ones!
Clothes that she would enjoy wearing, even if there were
only so very few of them!</p>

<p>In my case they were so few that I really did not feel
that they could support any sort of kit-inspection.
Especially under the eyes of mere male men, who never
do understand anything that has to do with our
attire.</p>

<p>There I stood, in the only frock I had got, in the
only other apron and cap (all exquisite of their kind,
mind you!), and I said falteringly: "I am very sorry to
be disobliging! But I cannot consent to let you search
my things, or open my boxes."</p>

<p>"Looks very bad, indeed, that's all I can say," broke
out the stout Hebrew gentleman excitedly. "Afraid
we shall be obliged to do so, officer, whether this young
woman wants to let us or not."</p>

<p>"You can't," I protested. "Nobody can search a
person's box against their will!"</p>

<p>I remember hearing from Million, in the old days
of heart-to-heart confidences about her "other situations,"
that this was "The law of the land."</p>

<p>No mistress had the right of opening the trunk of a
reluctant maid on her, the mistress's, own responsibility!</p>

<p>"We might find ourselves obliged to do so, Madam,"
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;186]</span>
put in the Scotland Yard man in a quiet, expressionless
voice. "We might take steps to enable us to examine
this young lady's belongings, if we find it necessary."</p>

<p>"Very well, then, charge me! Get an order, or whatever
it's called," I said quietly but firmly. I meditated
swiftly. "Getting an order" might take time, quite a
lot of time! Anything to do with "the law" seems
to take such ages before it happens! In that time Miss
Million would, I hope to goodness! have turned up again.
If she were here I should not feel so helpless as I do
now&mdash;a girl absolutely "on her own," with all her visible
means of support (notably her heiress-mistress)
taken from her!</p>

<p>"Oh, we hope that it will not be found necessary,"
persisted the manager, who, I suspect, thought he was
being very nice about the affair. "I am sure Miss
Smith will only have to think the matter over to see
the reasonableness of what is being asked her. Here
we are, in this big hotel, all sorts of people coming and
going&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Coming and going" rather described my absent
mistress's procedure. "And we find suddenly that a
piece of very valuable jewellery is missing."</p>

<p>"The Rattenheimer ruby! Not another like it in the
world!" cried the stout and excited Jew. "I won't tell
you how much I gave for that stone! My wife wears
it as a pendant, unmounted, just pierced so as to hold
on a gold chain.... I won't let that be lost, I can
tell you! I will search everywhere, everything, everybody.
I tell you, young woman, you need not imagine
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;187]</span>
that you can get out of having your boxes overhauled,
if it takes all Scotland Yard to do it!"</p>

<p>Here the pleasant, rather slow voice of the American
with the unfamiliar note in boots and clothes and thick,
mouse-coloured hair broke in upon the other man's yapping.
"Ca'm yourself, Rats. Ca'm yourself. You
keep quite ca'm and easy. You won't get anything out
of a young lady like this by your film-acting and your
shouts!"</p>

<p>"I tell her I'll have her searched."</p>

<p>"Not with my consent," I said, feeling absolutely determined
now. "And to do it without my consent you
have to wait."</p>

<p>"I shall go through the other girl's things, then,
first," snorted the excited Jew. "What's the name of
the girl this one's alleged to be working for?" In
every look and tone the man voiced his conviction that
poor little Million and I were two notorious, practised
jewel thieves in a new disguise.</p>

<p>"This woman who calls herself Million, I will go
through her things."</p>

<p>"You will not," I said stiffly. "My mistress is out.
I will not allow any of her things to be touched during
her absence. That is my duty."</p>

<p>"That's so," said the young American softly.</p>

<p>The excited Jew man almost grimaced with rage.
Loudly he demanded: "Out, is she? 'Out'? Where
may that be?"</p>

<p>How ardently I wished that I knew, myself!</p>

<p>But all I said was: "I fail to see that it has got anything
to do with you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;188]</span>
"Probably," said the manager soothingly, "probably
when Miss Million returns she will persuade Miss
Smith to be more reasonable."</p>

<p>"They are in league together! It is a put-up job!
These two girls ... Half the hotel's talking about
them.... There is something fishy about them. I
will find out what it is," the fat Jew was bubbling,
while the young American took him by the arm and
walked him quietly towards the door. The Scotland
Yard man had already unobtrusively disappeared.
Last of all the manager went, with quite a pleasant
nod and quite a friendly, "Well, Miss Smith, I expect
you will think better of it presently."</p>

<p>I know that all four of them suspects me! They
think that Million and I know something about this
wretched Rattenheimer ruby, or whatever it is. Perhaps
they think that we are in communication with
gangs of jewellery thieves all over Europe? Perhaps
they imagine that I am left here to mount guard over
some other loot while Million has gone over for a trip
to Hamburg or Rotterdam, or wherever it is that people
do go with stolen jewels?</p>

<p>And for all I know she may be doing something just
as idiotic&mdash;the silly girl, getting her head turned and
her hair decorated by moon-calves of young lords!...
Oh! I wish there was any one to whom I could turn
for advice! There is not a soul.</p>

<p>That nice, sensible, reliable Mr. Brace is by this
time in Paris. Out of reach! As for Mr. Burke, he is
gallivanting at Brighton, and, of course, one could not
depend upon him, anyhow!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;189]</span>
I feel I must go out.</p>

<p>It's evening, which means that Million has been away
from the hotel for twenty-four hours. I have not left
it except for that flying visit to the "Thousand and
One" Club.</p>

<p>Get a breath of fresh air before dinner I simply must.
My head seems whirling round and round, and my
nerves feel as if something in them has snapped with a
loud twang like a violin string. I shall go out&mdash;if they
will let me, but I should not be at all surprised if the
manager of the hotel and the Rattenheimer creature between
them did not mean to let me stir out of their
sight.</p>

<p>Still, I shall try. I shall take a little turn on the
Embankment, and watch the barges on the river. That
ought to have a soothing influence.</p>

<p>How perfectly terrible if I am stopped in the vestibule!...</p>

<p>I was not stopped.</p>

<p>Nobody seemed to see me go out.</p>

<p>But when I got out into the Strand, with its summer
evening crowds of people, I happened to glance
across the street, and beheld some one that I had just
seen in my room&mdash;namely, the quiet-faced man from
Scotland Yard. How awful! I was being shadowed!
It was a horrible feeling. So horrible that I am sure
it could not have been any worse if I had really taken
the Rattenheimer ruby, and had it fastened securely inside
my black coat at the moment!</p>

<p>I felt as if I had. I wondered if the man would
come across and dog my footsteps!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;190]</span>
I turned down one of the little quiet streets on the
right that lead to the river, and then I did hear footsteps
behind me. They were following&mdash;positively following&mdash;me!</p>

<p>"Good evening!" said a quite friendly but un-English
voice. It was not the Scotland Yard detective,
then, after all. I turned. It was the young American.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Pg_191" id="Pg_191">[Pg&nbsp;191]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<h3>HER COUSIN TO THE RESCUE</h3>

<p class="noindent">"<span class="smcap">Good</span> evening," I said, coldly looking up at the young
man, with a glance that said as plainly as possible,
"What do you want?"</p>

<p>"I hoped you might be kind enough to allow me to
escort you on this little stroll of yours, Miss Smith,"
said the young American politely, lifting his grey felt
hat. "See here, I guess I'd better introdooce myself.
I'm Hiram P. Jessop, of Chicago."</p>

<p>"You are a detective, too, I suppose," I said, still
more coldly. We were standing by the railings of the
old London churchyard close to the river. The dark-green
leaves of the plane-trees rustled above us. "I
suppose you are following me to find out if I'm taking
Mr. Rattenheimer's ruby to a pawnshop?"</p>

<p>The young American smiled cheerfully down at
me.</p>

<p>"Nix on the detective racket here," he said, in his
queer, slow, pleasant accent. "You can cut out that
about Rats and his ruby, I guess. I don't care a row
o' beans where his old ruby has gann to. What I
wanted to ask you about was&mdash;&mdash;" He concluded with
a most unexpected two words&mdash;</p>

<p>&mdash;"My cousin!"</p>

<p>I stared up at this big young stranger in the padded
grey coat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;192]</span>
"Your cousin? But&mdash;I think you're making some
mistake&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I guess not," said the young American. "You're
my cousin's maid all right, aren't you? You're Miss
Million's maid?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Yes, of course," I said, clinging on to that
one straw of fact in an ocean of unexpectedness. "I'm
her maid&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And I'm her cousin," said the young American
simply. "Second cousin, or second, once removed&mdash;or
something of that sort. You haven't heard of
me?"</p>

<p>"No, I never have heard of any of Miss Million's
cousins," I said, shaking my head with a gesture of
firm disbelief. For I summed up his claim to relationship
with my mistress as being about as authentic as
the Honourable Jim's alleged friendship with her uncle.</p>

<p>Only the fibbing of this second young man seemed
rather more shameless!</p>

<p>I said: "I didn't know that Miss Million had any
cousins."</p>

<p>"And you don't believe it now you hear it? Is that
so?" he said, still smiling cheerfully. "Why, it's
quite right to be on the side of caution. But you're
overdoing it, Miss Smith. I'm related to old man Million
right enough. Why, I'm at the boss-end of no end
of his business. The Sausage King. Well, I've been
the Sausage Prince. I see you looking at me as much
as to say, 'You say so.' See here, d'you want some
proofs? I've a wad of letters from the old man in
my pocket now."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;193]</span>
He put his hand to the breast of the grey-tweed
jacket.</p>

<p>"Maybe you think those aren't proofs, either?
Write myself a few billets-doux signed, 'Yours cordially,
Sam Million'&mdash;easy as falling off a horse, eh?"</p>

<p>(Of course, this was what I had thought.)</p>

<p>"I guess I shall have to take you and my cousin
along with me to our lawyers the next time I'm calling,
that's all," concluded the young American with his
cheerfully philosophical air. "Chancery Lane, Messrs.
Chesterton, Brown, Jones, and Robinson. That's the
firm."</p>

<p>"Oh! You know Mr. Chesterton!" I exclaimed in
accents of relief. I'd quite forgotten Miss Million's
dear old family lawyer. That nice old gentleman! If I
wanted advice or help of course there was Mr. Chesterton
to fall back on! I hadn't thought of him before.</p>

<p>"Know Mr. Chesterton? Sure thing," said the
American. We had moved away from the churchyard
railings and were strolling slowly towards the embankment
now. "Why, Mr. Chesterton and I had a long,
long heart-to-heart talk this afternoon, before I came
on in the great trunk-searching act! I was just coming
in to leave a card on my cousin, Miss Nellie Million,
when I found myself one of the galaxy of beauty and
talent that was going to make a thorough examination
of you girls' things."</p>

<p>"Oh, were you?" I said lamely. I couldn't think
what else to say. Too many things had been happening
all day long!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;194]</span>
I said: "Miss Million didn't know you were coming?</p>

<p>"Why, no! I guess she didn't suspect my existence,
any more than I suspected hers until a few weeks ago,"
said Miss Million's cousin. (At last I found myself
believing that he really was her cousin after all.)
"Horrible shock to me, I can tell you, that my Uncle
Sam was cherishing the thought of this little English
niece of his all this time! Making up his mind to leave
his pile to this girl. Meantime Hiram P. Jessop," here
he tapped the grey-tweed jacket again, "had been looking
upon himself as the heir-apparent!"</p>

<p>"Oh! You thought all that money was coming to
you?" I said, half-amused, half-pityingly, for this was
certainly the frankest, most boyish sort of young man
I'd ever come across. "And you've lost it all on account
of my mistress?"</p>

<p>"Say, doesn't that sound the queerest ever? A daisy
little girl like you talking about some other girl as her
'mistress'!" rejoined my companion in a wondering
tone. "Why, d'you know? When I saw you standing
there in the sitting-room, in your black dress and that
cute little apron and cap, I said to myself: 'If this isn't
the image of some Society girl of the English upper
class playing the Pretty Domestic part in some private
theatricals where they rush you a quarter's salary, I
guess, for half a look and a programme!' I said, if
you'll pardon me: 'It's just the accent, just the look,
just the manner.'"</p>

<p>"Oh!" I said, rather vexed.</p>

<p>I was annoyed that he should think there was any
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;195]</span>
trace of "acting" about my appearance. I thought I'd
had the art that conceals Art. I thought I'd come to
look such an irreproachable lady's-maid.</p>

<p>"Just typically the English Young Lady of the
Upper Classes," pronounced this surprising young
American, meditatively walking along by my side on
the asphalt paths of the Embankment Gardens. "As
typical as the Westminster Abbey, or those tea-shops....
Real sweet-looking, real refined-looking, if
I may say so. But cold! Cold and stiff! 'Do not dare
to approach me, for all my family were here dying of
old age when William the Conqueror landed on these
shores.' That's the way you'd impress one, Miss
Smith. 'Look through my trunks?'" Here he adopted
an extraordinary voice that I suppose was intended for
an imitation of my own tones.</p>

<p>Then he pulled himself up and said gravely: "You'll
pardon me if I'm too frank. But I'm always outspoken.
It's my nature. I'm interested in types. I
was interested in yours. Noo to me. Quite noo. The
young lady that looks as if she ought to be standing
to have her portrait painted on the grey-stone steps
of some big English country house&mdash;the young lady that
turns out to be paid maid to my own cousin! A noo
thing."</p>

<p>"Really!" I said gravely. I couldn't help feeling
amused at his puzzled face.</p>

<p>We turned again down the asphalt path between the
flower-beds of those gardens that are overshadowed by
the big hotel. On a bench I caught sight again of the
quiet figure that I had noticed on the other side of
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;196]</span>
the Strand. It was the Scotland Yard man. He seemed
to be reading an evening paper. But I felt that he was
watching, watching....</p>

<p>I didn't mind; even if he did think he was watching
some one who knew what had become of the Rattheimer
ruby! I felt something comforting and trustworthy in
the presence of this other young man; this peculiar
cousin of Million's, from whom one heard, quite unresentfully,
remarks that one would not forgive in an
Englishman, for instance Mr. Brace. Not that Mr.
Brace would ever venture on such personalities ... the
Honourable Jim now.... Yes, but he's a Celt. A
Celt is a person who takes, but cannot give, offence.
Most unfair, of course.</p>

<p>The American pursued: "And this cousin of mine?
There's another type I shall be interested to see. Tell
me about her, Miss Smith, will you? Have you known
her long?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," I said. "It's some years since I've known
Miss Million."</p>

<p>"And well, considering the difference in your positions,
that is?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, fairly well," I said, thinking of the many
artless confidences I'd listened to from Miss Million&mdash;then
"Million," of our disgracefully inconvenient little
kitchen at Putney. Those far-away days seemed very
pleasant and peaceful to me to-night! But they&mdash;those
kitchen days&mdash;were no part of the business of
the young man at my side.</p>

<p>"D'you get on with her?" he said.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, thank you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;197]</span>
"You don't tell me much. It's this English reserve
I'm always up against. It's a thing you'd need an ice-axe
for, I guess, or a hundred years with your families
living in the same village," complained the young
American, laughing ruefully.</p>

<p>"Were you two girls raised together? School together?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no."</p>

<p>He sighed and went off on another tack.</p>

<p>"Can't you tell me the way she looks, so as to prepare
me some for when I see her?" he suggested.
"Does she resemble you, Miss Smith?"</p>

<p>"I don't think so," I said, suppressing a foolish
giggle. It was the first time I'd wanted to laugh at
anything for the last twenty-four hours. "No; Miss
Million is&mdash;well, she's about my height. But she's
dark."</p>

<p>"I've always admired the small brunette woman myself,"
admitted Mr. Hiram P. Jessop, adding quickly
and courteously: "Not that I don't think it's perfectly
lovely to see a blonde with the bright chestnut hair and
the brown eyes that you have."</p>

<p>"Thank you," I said.</p>

<p>"And how soon can I see this little dark-haired
cousin of mine?" went on the American when we turned
out of the Gardens. Unobtrusively the Scotland Yard
man had risen also. "What time can I call around this
evening?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't know when she'll be in," I hesitated.</p>

<p>"Where's she gone to?" persisted the cousin of this
missing heiress. "How long did she go for?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;198]</span>
I fenced with this question until we arrived at the
very doors of the Cecil again.</p>

<p>Then an impulse seized me.</p>

<p>All day long I had wrestled alone with this trouble
of mine. I hadn't consulted Mr. Brace. I had kept it
from the Honorable Jim. I had put up all sorts of
pretences about it to the people at the hotel. But I
felt now that it would have to come out. I couldn't
stand it any longer.</p>

<p>I turned to Miss Million's cousin.</p>

<p>"Mr. Jessop, I must tell you," I said in a serious
and measured voice. "The truth is I don't know!"</p>

<p>"What?" he took up, startled. "Are you telling
me that you don't know where my cousin is at this
moment?"</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>"I wish I did know," I said fervently. And as we
stood, a little aside from the glass doors in the vestibule,
I went on, in soft, rapid tones, to tell him the
story of Miss Million's disappearance from my horizon
since half-past eleven last night.</p>

<p>I looked up, despairingly, into his startled, concerned
face.</p>

<p>"What has happened to her?" I said urgently.
"What do you think? Where do you think she is?"</p>

<p>Before he could say a word a messenger came up to
me with a telegram.</p>

<p>"For Miss Smith."</p>

<p>I felt that this would be news at last. It must be.
I seized the wire; I tore it open.</p>

<p>I read&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;199]</span>
"Oh!" I cried quite loudly.</p>

<p>One of the commissionaires glanced curiously over
his shoulder at me.</p>

<p>I dropped my voice as I said feverishly: "Yes, it is!
It's from <span class="smcap">her</span>!"</p>

<p>And I held the telegram out, blindly, towards the
young American.</p>

<p>The telegram which my mistress had sent ran simply
and superbly thus:</p>

<p class="blockquot1">"Why ever don't you bring my clothes?</p>

<p class="blockquotr">"<span class="smcap">Miss Million.</span>"
</p>

<p>There was no address.</p>

<p>The wire had been handed in at half-past seven
o'clock that evening at Lewes. It left me silent for
a moment with bewilderment and dismay. After waiting
so long for a message! To receive one that told
me nothing!</p>

<p>"What is the meaning of this here?" said Miss
Million's cousin, repeating, in the accent that makes
all our English words sound something new and strange.
"'Why ever don't you bring my clothes?' Well! I
guess that sounds as if nothing very terrible had happened
to her. Her clothes! A woman's first thought,
of course. Where does she want you to 'bring' them to,
Miss Smith?"</p>

<p>"How on earth should I know?" I cried, in desperation.
"When I still don't know where she is, or what
she is doing!"</p>

<p>"But this place, Lewes. Surely that's some guide to
you?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;200]</span>
"Not the slightest," I said. "We don't know anybody
at Lewes! At least, I don't know that she knew
anybody there! I don't know who on earth can have
taken her there!" This with another nervous thought
of young Lord Fourcastles. "I shall have to go at
once&mdash;no, it's too late to-night. To-morrow I shall go.
But&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"She may not be there at all. She may have been
motoring through when she sent this absurd wire!"</p>

<p>"Maybe," said the American. "But it's a clue, for
all that. Lewes! The post-offices at Lewes will tell
you something about her."</p>

<p>"Why, why didn't she tell me something about herself?"
I stormed softly. "Here she is taking it for
granted that I know exactly what's happened and
where she's gone! Does she imagine that she explained
that to me last night before she went out? Does she
think she gave me any orders? Here she is actually
asking 'why?' to me!" I concluded, stammering with
indignation. "She sounds quite furious because I
haven't brought her clothes to her&mdash;&mdash;somewhere in
Space!"</p>

<p>"What clothes was she wearing, may I ask?" demanded
the American cousin, in his simple, boyishly
interested manner.</p>

<p>And when I told him of the bright, cherry-coloured
evening gown, and the creamy restaurant coat, and the
little cerise satin shoes with jewelled heels that Million
had on, he put back his head and laughed gently.</p>

<p>"Poor little girl! Poor little Cousin Nellie! I guess
she must have been real mad with herself and you for
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;201]</span>
letting her loose in that get-up," he said, "prancing
about all day in the bright sunlight in that outfit.
Enough to jar any girl of taste in dress, I guess!"</p>

<p>Then his alert face grew grave again. He said,
glancing over his shoulder at the groups that were
coming and going in the vestibule: "Well, we'll discuss
this. Come into the lounge, where we can talk quietly."</p>

<p>We went into the lounge, where only yesterday I
had perceived for the first time the sumptuous apparition
of Miss Vi Vassity pouring out tea for my now
vanished mistress.</p>

<p>It seemed to me that everybody there looked up at
me as we passed in. I bit my lip and frowned a little.</p>

<p>"You are right. This is no place for a quiet chat,"
said the American softly. "It will have to be my
cousin's sitting-room again, I reckon."</p>

<p>Upstairs, in Miss Million's sitting-room, that I
seemed to know as well now as a penal-servitude prisoner
knows his cell, the American said to me gravely
and quietly: "There is one thing, I daresay, which
you have not thought of in connection with that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He nodded his smooth, mouse-coloured head at the
tantalising wire that I still held crushed in my hand.</p>

<p>"Now, I don't know much about your police system,"
said young Mr. Jessop, "but I reckon it won't be
so very different from our own in a matter of this nature."
He nodded again, and went on gravely:</p>

<p>"That telegram will have been read all right! The
people here, the manager and the Scotland Yard man,
they will know what's in that."</p>

<p>"Know what's in it?" I gasped, staring at him.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;202]</span>
"Why, how can they? Do you mean," indignantly,
"that they opened it?"</p>

<p>"Why, no! You saw for yourself the envelope was
not opened when you got the thing. But that is not to
say that they could not get it repeated, as easy as
winking, at the post-office," said Mr. Hiram P. Jessop,
of Chicago. "So I'd be ready to bet that everybody
here knows what you're up to when you leave this hotel
to-morrow. My old acquaintance, Rats, and all of 'em.
They'll know you're taking something to your young
mistress&mdash;your confederate, they'll think her!&mdash;in Sussex.
You may be quite sure they're not going to allow
you to take any trips into Sussex&mdash;alone. Nope.
Somebody will go with you, Miss Smith."</p>

<p>"Go with me? D'you mean," I said, "that I shall
be shadowed all the way by that odious detective man?"</p>

<p>"Well, now, isn't it more than probable, Miss
Smith?" said the young American shrewdly. "They'd
their eye on you two girls from the start, it seems.
You aren't a very usual couple. Noo to me, you are.
Both of you seemed noo to them!"</p>

<p>"I knew they gossiped about us!" I said ruefully.</p>

<p>"Sure thing; but don't say 'gossip' as if it was
something nobody else did only the folks around this
hotel!" protested the American, twinkling. "Well, to-day
after the great Jewel Steal you aroused considerable
suspicion by refusing to let Rats and the others do
the Custom House officer's act through your wardrobe.
This wire will have raised more suspicion this evening.
And to-morrow&mdash;d'you think they're going to let you
quit without further notice taken? Think!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;203]</span>
I thought for a second.</p>

<p>I saw that he was perfectly right.</p>

<p>It was just what would happen. Wherever I went
to-morrow in search of that baffling mistress of mine I
should have that Scotland Yard detective on my
heels!</p>

<p>That sort of thing made me terribly nervous and
uneasy! But I could imagine the ingenuous Million
being forty times worse about it! If I did succeed in
running her to earth at last, I could just imagine Million's
unconcealed and compromising horror at seeing
me turn up with a companion who talked about "the
necessary steps" and "the Law!"</p>

<p>Million would be so overwhelmed that she would look
as if she had a whole mine full of stolen rubies sewn
into the tops of her corsets. She has a wild and baseless
horror of anything to do with the police. (I saw
her once, at home, when a strange constable called to
inquire about a lost dog. It was I who'd had to go
to the door. Million had sat, shuddering, in the kitchen,
her hand on her apron-bib, and her whole person suffering
from what she calls "the palps.")</p>

<p>So this was going to be awkward, hideously awkward.</p>

<p>Yet I couldn't go out in search of her!</p>

<p>I said, desperately: "What am I to do about it?"</p>

<p>"There is only one thing for it as far as I can see,"
said the young American thoughtfully; "you will have
to let me go down with a suit-case full of lady's wearing
apparel. You will have to let me make all the inquiries
in Lewes."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;204]</span>
"You? Oh, no! That is quite impossible," I exclaimed
firmly. "You could not."</p>

<p>"Why not? I tell you, Miss Smith, it seems to me
just to meet the case," he said earnestly.</p>

<p>"Here's this little cousin of mine, that I have never
yet seen, that I've got to make friends with. I am to
be allowed to make her acquaintance by doing her a
service. Now, isn't that the real, old-fashioned Anglo-Saxon
chivalry? It would just appeal to me."</p>

<p>"I don't think it would appeal to Miss Million," I
said, "to have a perfectly strange young man suddenly
making his appearance in the middle of&mdash;wherever she
is, with a box full of all sorts of her things, and saying
he is her cousin! No, I shall have to go," I said.</p>

<p>And then a sudden awful thought struck me. How
far could I go on the money that was left to me?
Three and sixpence!</p>

<p>"My goodness! What's the railway fare from Victoria,
or wherever you go to Lewes from? I don't believe
I have got it!" I turned to the young man with
a resigned sigh of desperation. "I shall have to borrow
from you," I said.</p>

<p>"With great pleasure," said the young American
promptly. Then, with a twinkle, he added swiftly:
"See here, Miss Smith. Cut out the railroad business
altogether. Far better if you were to permit me to
take you down by automobile. Will you let me do that,
now? I can hire an automobile and tear off a hundred
miles or so of peaceful English landscape before anybody
has had time to say 'How very extraordinary!'
which is the thing they always are saying in England
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;205]</span>
when any remark is put forward about what they do
in the States. Pack up my cousin's contraptions to-night,
will you? To-morrow morning, at nine or eight
or seven if you like, we'll buzz out of this little old
town and play baseball with all the police traps between
here and Brighton! Does this appeal to you?"</p>

<p>I could not help feeling that this did very considerably
appeal to me.</p>

<p>If I went with this un-English, unconventional, but
kind and helpful young man, I should at least not feel
such a lone, lorn female, such a suspect in the eyes of
the law! I could rise superior to the dogging of detectives,
just as I had risen superior to them this evening
in the Embankment Gardens.</p>

<p>Suffragists and college-educated girls and enlightened
persons of that sort may say what they choose on
the subject of woman becoming daily more self-reliant
and independent of man.</p>

<p>But I don't care. The fact remains that to the average
girl-in-a-scrape the presence of man, sympathetic
and efficient, does still appear the one and only and
ideal prop!</p>

<p>Bless Mr. Hiram P. Jessop, of Chicago! I was only
too thankful to accept the offer of his escort&mdash;and of
his car!</p>

<p>Before he left me I had arranged to meet him at a
certain garage at nine o'clock in the morning.</p>

<p>"Bright and early, as we may want to have the whole
day before us," said the American as he went out.
"Till then, Miss Smith!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<h3>I START ON THE QUEST</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">And</span> now to set about sorting out some of these
"clothes," after which my young mistress inquires so
peremptorily! It won't take me long, thanks to the
apple-pie order in which I keep them all. (So much
easier to be "tidy" with new and gorgeous garments
than it is with a chest of drawers full of makeshifts!)</p>

<p>I shall take her dressing-bag with the crystal-and-ivory
fittings. That ought to impress even the Fourcastles'
ménage, assuming that Lord Fourcastles has
carried her off to his people's. I wonder whose dressing
things and whose dress Miss Million made use of
to-day? For, seriously, of course, she can't have gone
"prancing about" in "me cerise evenin'-one." She
must have worn borrowed plumes for the day&mdash;plumes
probably miles too long for the sturdy little barn-door
chicken that Million is! I wonder, I wonder from whom
those plumes were borrowed? Please Heaven I shall
know by this time to-morrow night!...</p>

<p>Here's her week-end case packed up. The choice of
two costumes; the blue cloth and the tobacco-brown
taffeta; blouses; a complete set of luxurious undies.
Even the slip petticoat was an "under-dress" according
to the shops Miss Million patronised! Shoes; a
hat; a motor-veil and wrap. Yes, that's all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;207]</span>
That ought to do her&mdash;when we get the things to
her!</p>

<p>But now to bed and to sleep the sleep of exhaustion
after quite the most crowded day of my whole life.</p>

<p>To-morrow for Lewes&mdash;and more adventure!</p>

<p>We were shadowed on our Lewes journey, though
scarcely in the way that I had anticipated. However,
to begin at the beginning.</p>

<p>At nine o'clock this morning, in spite of all difficulties,
I did find myself free of the "Cecil" and away
in a two-seater with my mistress's luggage, sitting beside
my mistress's cousin and whirling through the dull
and domesticated streets of South London.</p>

<p>It was a gorgeous June day, just the very day for a
quick flight out into the country. In spite of my anxiety
about my mistress my spirits rose and rose. I
could have sung aloud for joy as we left grimy London
behind us and found ourselves whirling nearer the green
heart of the country.</p>

<p>"This is better than your first idea of the railroad
trip, Miss Smith?" said the young American at my
side.</p>

<p>"Oh, far more enjoyable," I agreed so eagerly that
he laughed.</p>

<p>"There is another thing about that," he said. "I
suppose you haven't thought of what they would do if
they saw you going off by train anywhere?"</p>

<p>"What?" I asked, looking up at him with startled
eyes.</p>

<p>"Why, they would wire to every station along the
line to take notice where you got off before Lewes,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;208]</span>
and to follow up all your movements, you real, artful,
detective-dodging little diamond thief you," declared my
companion teasingly.</p>

<p>And I saw him simply shaking with laughter over
the steering-wheel as he went on.</p>

<p>"The brilliant idea of Rats, and the manager, that
you and my little cousin Nellie should have gotten hold
of his old ruby!"</p>

<p>"You knew at once," I said, "that we hadn't!"</p>

<p>And he laughed easily and said: "It didn't take much
guessing when he had seen me and knew that Nellie
Million was a relative of his and a niece of the old
man's."</p>

<p>"Jewel thieves, not much!" he said in his quick, reassuring
accent.</p>

<p>I said: "Well! I hope you put in a good word for
us with that odious little Jew man that lost the
ruby."</p>

<p>"Not on your life! I just love to watch somebody
who thinks they are too quick and clever to live go
over-reaching themselves some," said the American
good-humouredly.</p>

<p>How funny it felt to be sitting there beside him,
while the hedges whirled past&mdash;I, who had never set
eyes on the young man before yesterday, now joining
him in this wild quest of a cousin whom he had never
yet seen!</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! I wonder if we shall find her!" I murmured.</p>

<p>"Why, I am determined not to close an eye to-night
until we do, Miss Smith," said the missing heiress's
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;209]</span>
cousin, gravely looking ahead at the sliding ribbon of
white road. "It's a matter of some little importance
to me that we find her soon. It is also no less important
what I think of her when we do meet!"</p>

<p>I was a little surprised to hear him speak so impressively.
Naturally, when one is going to meet a
relative for the first time one wonders what sort of
a mutual impression will be made. But why had this
young man said so seriously that this was "important"?</p>

<p>He seemed to read my thoughts, for, as we cleared
a village and came out into a long stretch of wide and
empty road, he turned to me and said: "You know, it
is as a matter of business that I am coming to see this
cousin of mine and this mistress of yours. I have got
to have a little serious heart-to-heart talk with her on
the subject of the old man's money."</p>

<p>"Why?" I asked, startled. "Isn't it safe in that
factory place where Mr. Chesterton said it had better
be kept?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it is safe enough there," he said. "The question
is, is all that money going to be allowed to remain
in the hands of one little dark-haired girl without
let or hindrance, as the lawyers say?"</p>

<p>"Allowed?" I echoed. "But who is to disallow it?"</p>

<p>There was a moment's silence.</p>

<p>Then the young American said meditatively: "I
might! That is, I might have a try. True, it mightn't
come off. I don't say that it is bound to come off.
But, between you and me, the old gentleman was
remarkably queer in his head when he made that second
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;210]</span>
will, leaving the whole pile to his niece, Miss Nellie
Million. The will he made a couple of years before,
leaving everything to his nephew, Hiram P. Jessop,
might be proved to be the valid one yet, if I liked to go
setting things to work."</p>

<p>At the sound of this a dark cloud seemed to blot
out some of the June sunshine that was steeping the
white roads and the hawthorn hedges and the emerald-green
fields of corn "shot" with scarlet poppies.</p>

<p>Poor little unsuspecting Million! Wherever she was,
she had not an idea of this&mdash;that the fortune which
she had only just begun to enjoy might be yet snapped
out of her hands, leaving no trace of it behind but the
costly new trousseau of clothes, a gorgeous array of
trunks, and an unpaid hotel bill!</p>

<p>How terrible! It would be worse than if she had
never had any money at all! For it is odd how quickly
we women acclimatise ourselves to personal luxuries,
even though we have not been brought up to them.
For instance, already since I had had my own new
things I felt that I could never bear to go back to
lisle thread or cashmere stockings again. Only silk
were possible for Miss Million's maid! Another awful
thought. Supposing Miss Million ceased to be an
heiress? She would then cease to require the services
of a lady's-maid. And then I should be indeed upon
the rocks!</p>

<p>Again that weird young American seemed to read
my thoughts. Dryly he said: "You see yourself out
of a job already, Miss Smith?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed, I don't," I said with spirit. "You
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;211]</span>
have not got the money yet, my mistress is still in possession
of it."</p>

<p>"And possession is nine-tenths of the law, you
mean," he took up; "still I might choose to fight on
the tenth point, mightn't I?"</p>

<p>He put back his head and laughed.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I shan't have to fight. This entirely depends
upon how Nellie and I are going to fix it up
when we do meet," he said cheerily.</p>

<p>"We have got to find her first," I said, with a feeling
of apprehension coming over me again. And this
young American who may have control of our future
(mine and Miss Million's) said cheerfully: "We are
going to find her or know why, I guess. Don't you get
worrying."</p>

<p>Such an easy thing to say: "Don't worry"!</p>

<p>As if I hadn't had enough to worry me already!
Now this fresh apprehension! I felt my face getting
longer and longer and more despondent inside the frame
of the thin black motor-scarf with which I had wreathed
my hat. The young American glanced at it and smiled
encouragingly.</p>

<p>"I guess you are starving with hunger," he said;
"I'll wager you hadn't the horse sense to eat a decent
breakfast before you started away from the
'Cess'? Tea and toast, what? I knew it. Now, see
here, we are going to climb right down and have a nice
early lunch at the first hostelry that we come to, with
honeysuckle and English roses climbing over the
porch."</p>

<p>It was hardly a mile further on that we came to
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;212]</span>
a wayside inn such as he had described. There it
was, a white-washed, low-roofed house, with roses and
creepers, with a little bit of green in front of it, and a
swinging painted sign, and a pond not far off, with a
big white duck and a procession of little yellow ducklings
waddling towards it across the road.</p>

<p>It looked quite like a page out of a Caldecott picture-book.
The only twentieth-century detail in it was the
other two-seater car that was drawn up just in front
of the porch. This was a car very much more gorgeous
than the hireling in which we were setting forth on
our quest. She&mdash;this other car&mdash;appeared to be glitteringly
new. The hedge-sparrow blue enamel and the
brass work were a dazzlement to the eyes in the brilliant
June sunshine. In front there was affixed the
mascot, a beautiful copy of "The Winged Victory,"
modelled in silver.</p>

<p>I wondered for a moment who the lucky owner of such
a gem of cars might be.</p>

<p>And then, even as I descended from the hireling, and
entered the inner porch with my companion, I thought
of the last time that I had heard a small car mentioned.</p>

<p>That was Lord Fourcastles's!</p>

<p>The gnarled-looking old woman who kept this decorative-looking
inn shook her head doubtfully over the
idea of being able to let us have lunch as early as all
that.</p>

<p>"Mid-day dinner," she informed us rather reproachfully,
"was at mid-day!"</p>

<p>However, if bread and cheese and cider would do us
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;213]</span>
those we could have. She had taken a tray with those on
already to the gentleman who had driven up in a small
car, if we wouldn't mind having it in the little coffee-room
with him.</p>

<p>Thankfully enough I preceded Mr. Jessop into the
coffee-room. It was long, and low-ceilinged, and dark
from the screen of tangled ivy and honeysuckle and
jasmine that grew up about the low window. Inside
was a framed picture of Queen Victoria as a blonde girl
in a dressing-gown receiving the news of her accession
to the English throne. Another picture showed her in
Jubilee robes. There were also cases of stuffed birds
and squirrels, padded chairs with woollen antimacassars.
At the further table there loomed against the
light the broad back of a man eating bread and cheese
and reading a newspaper. From the look of him, he
was the owner of that sumptuous car.</p>

<p>My American friend exclaimed in delight.</p>

<p>"Well, now, if any one had told me there still
existed anything so real old-fashioned and quaint right
close up to the most sophisticated old town in Europe
I would never have believed them!" he ejaculated. "It
takes Old England to supply anything in the nature
of a setting for romance. Doesn't this look the exact
parlour where the runaway couple would be fixing things
up with the relenting pa on the way back from Gretna
Green, Miss Smith?"</p>

<p>I laughed as I said: "It is rather a long way from
here to Gret&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here there was a sudden noise of a man springing
quickly to his feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;214]</span>
The guest, who had been sitting there over his bread
and cheese and cider, swung swiftly round.</p>

<p>"By the powers, but this is a delightful surprise!"
he exclaimed.</p>

<p>I stared up at him with eyes now grown accustomed
to the dimness of the inn parlour. I beheld, handsomer
and more débonnaire than ever, no less a person than
the Honourable Jim Burke!</p>

<p>As I shook hands I wondered swiftly from whom
this blue-eyed pirate had borrowed the brand-new, spick-and-span
little car that stood outside there with her
nose and the mascot that was its ornament turned
towards London.</p>

<p>I saw young Mr. Jessop staring with all his shrewd
yet boyish eyes. I wondered what on earth he thought
of my very conspicuous-looking friend; no, I can't call
him "friend" exactly, my conspicuous-looking acquaintance
to whom I hurriedly introduced him?</p>

<p>"Very happy to meet you," said the American, bowing.
Mr. Burke, with the most extraordinary flavour
of an American accent tinging his brogue, added: "Delighted
to make your acquaintance, Mr. Jessop."</p>

<p>Without my seeing how he did it exactly, Mr. Burke
had arranged the chairs about his table so that we all
sat at lunch there together. But he changed his seat
so that it was Mr. Jessop who sat with his face to the
light, opposite to the man I had known just a very little
longer.</p>

<p>Really, it does seem odd to think that I am the same
Beatrice Lovelace who used to live at No. 45 Laburnum
Grove! There, from year's end to year's end, I never
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;215]</span>
exchanged a single word with anything that you could
describe as a young man!</p>

<p>And now, to parody the old story about the 'bus
driver, "Young men are no treat to me!" Within
forty-eight hours I have had one propose to me, one
taking me out for a walk on the Embankment and
arranging to bring me for this motor expedition
to-day, and a third having lunch with me and the
second!</p>

<p>It was a very funny lunch. And not a very comfortable
one. The two men talked without ceasing
about automobiles, and "makes," and garages, and
speeds, and the difference between American and
English workmen. (Mr. Burke really does seem to know
something about America.) But I felt that the air of
that shady coffee-room was simply quivering with the
thoughts of both of them on very different subjects.
Mr. Jessop was thinking: "Now, see here! Who's this
young Irish aristocrat? He seems to be on such perfectly
friendly terms of equality with my cousin's maid.
How's this?"</p>

<p>Mr. Burke was thinking: "Who the dickens is this
fellow? How is it that Miss Million's maid seems to
be let loose for the whole day without her mistress,
and a young man and a car to herself?"</p>

<p>The keynote of the next half-hour might be summed
up in Kipling's phrase, "Man's timid heart is bursting
with the things he dare not say!"</p>

<p>My heart meanwhile was bursting with the wild longing
to find out if Mr. Burke knew anything at all of
the whereabouts of my mistress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;216]</span>
I decided that he did not, for if he had wouldn't he
have mentioned something to do with her?</p>

<p>As it was, which I am sure was buzzing in all of our
brains, the name Million did not pass any of our lips!</p>

<p>The men went out together, apparently on the most
friendly terms, to pay the landlady and exchange inspection
of the "automobiles." By some man[oe]uvring
or other Mr. Burke contrived to come back first into
the coffee-room where I stood alone before the mirror
readjusting the black gauze scarf.</p>

<p>He came behind and spoke to my reflection in the
mirror, smiling into the eyes that met his own blue
and unabashed ones in the glass.</p>

<p>"Child, a word with you," murmured the Honourable
Jim in his flattering and confidential tones. "Will
you tell me something? Does all this mean, now, that
my good services are no longer required in the way
of introducing to you with a view to matrimony the
wealthy alien that I mentioned at that charming tea
the day before yesterday, was it?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Mr. Burke?" I said. "What
do you mean by all this?"</p>

<p>The Honourable Jim jerked his smooth black head
towards the window, whence he could get a glimpse of
the waiting cars.</p>

<p>"I mean our friend, the American Eaglet, who is
so highly favoured that he doesn't even have to wait
until Friday afternoon off," said the Honourable Jim
softly, watching my face, "for his flights with the little
black-plumaged pigeon."</p>

<p>Naturally when one is watched one colours up. Who
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;217]</span>
could help it? The Honourable Jim said rather more
loudly: "I'll tell you something. You have every symptom
about you of a girl who has had a proposal of
marriage in the last couple of days. Didn't I see it at
lunch? The way you held your head! The new pride
in your voice! Something in the very movement of the
hand&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He caught me very gently by the wrist of my left
hand as he spoke. I hadn't yet put on my gloves.</p>

<p>"No ring there," said the Honourable Jim, dropping
the hand again. "But&mdash;Miss Lovelace, child! Will
you deny to me that some one has not proposed to you
since you and I had tea together?"</p>

<p>At that I could not help thinking of poor Mr. Brace
in Paris. He would be coming over at the end of the
week to receive the answer which I had not yet had
time to think about. I was so amazed at Mr. Burke's
perspicacity that I could not help reddening even
deeper with pure surprise. The Irishman said softly:
"I am answered! Tell me, when are you going over
to the Stars and Stripes?"</p>

<p>Good heavens! what an idiotic mistake. He really
imagined that the man who had proposed to me was not
Mr. Brace, but Mr. Hiram P. Jessop, of Chicago! I
protested incoherently: "Why! I only met him last
night."</p>

<p>"What is time to love?" laughed Mr. Burke.</p>

<p>"But don't be so ridiculous," I besought him.
"This Mr. Jessop has nothing to do with me! He
is&mdash;&mdash;" Here the conversation was stopped by the entrance
of Mr. Jessop himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;218]</span>
I think Mr. Hiram P. Jessop soon discovered that
Mr. Burke had made up his mind about one thing.</p>

<p>Namely, that he meant to start first from the inn
where we'd lunched!</p>

<p>He rose to say good-bye, and to add that he must
be "off" so very firmly, and just after he had helped
me to another plateful of raspberries drowned in
cream.</p>

<p>We shook hands, and in a few seconds we heard him
starting his motor&mdash;or rather, the Super-car that I
conclude he had borrowed, or "wangled," or whatever
he calls it, from one of his many wealthy friends.
Through the window I caught a flashing glimpse of this
hedge-sparrow-blue car with her silver mascot whizzing
past&mdash;on the road to Lewes.</p>

<p>This was odd, I thought.</p>

<p>For there was no doubt that when we pulled up at
the inn, that car's nose had been towards home, and
London.</p>

<p>Then we, too, started off for Lewes, and the inquiries
we had to make there.</p>

<p>This was when I discovered that Mr. Jessop and I
were, as I've said, "shadowed."</p>

<p>Mr. Burke, in that gorgeous car of his, had evidently
determined, for some obscure reason, not to
lose sight of us.</p>

<p>We overtook him, tooling leisurely along, a mile this
side of Uckfield.</p>

<p>We waved; we caught a cheery gleam of his white
teeth and black-lashed blue eyes. I thought that would
be the last of him. Oh, dear, no. A quarter of a mile
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;219]</span>
further on he appeared to the right by some cross-road.
And from then on he and the light-blue car kept appearing
and disappearing in our field of vision.</p>

<p>At one moment the light-blue and silver gleam of his
motor would flash through the midsummer green of
trees overshadowing some lane ahead of us. Again he
would appear a little behind and to the left. Presently,
again, to the right....</p>

<p>"That friend of yours seems to know the country
considerable well," remarked the American to me.
"Looks like as if he was chasing butterflies all over
it. Is he a great Nature-lover, Miss Smith?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't tell you," I said vaguely, and feeling
rather annoyed. "I don't know this Mr. Burke at all
well."</p>

<p>"Is that so?" said the young American gravely.</p>

<p>Near Lewes we lost sight of that glittering car; it
seemed finally.</p>

<p>I felt thoroughly relieved at that. He was a most
embarrassing sort of travelling companion, the Honourable
Jim!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<h3>WE SEEK "THE REFUGE"</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">We</span> (Mr. Jessop and I) drove slowly to the first post-office.</p>

<p>There we both alighted. And I in my impatience
fairly flung myself against the long counter with its
wirework screen that fenced off the post-office girls.</p>

<p>They stared curiously at the anxious-looking young
woman in black and the grey-clad, unmistakably American
young man, who both at once began to make
inquiries about a certain telegram which had been
handed in there at half-past seven o'clock the evening
before.</p>

<p>"Are you the person to whom the telegram was addressed?"
one of the girls asked almost suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Yes. I am Miss Smith. You see! Here is an
envelope addressed to me at the Hotel Cecil," I said,
feverishly producing that envelope (it belonged to Mr.
Brace's last note to me). "Can you tell me who handed
in this message?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't, I'm sure," said the girl who had spoken
suspiciously. "I was off last evening before six."</p>

<p>"Can you tell me who was here?" I demanded, fuming
at the delay.</p>

<p>The girls seemed blissfully unaware that this was a
matter of life and death to me.</p>

<p>"Miss Carfax was here, I believe," volunteered one
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;221]</span>
of the other girls, in the "parcels" division of the
long counter.</p>

<p>I asked eagerly: "Which is Miss Carfax, please?"</p>

<p>"Just gone to her lunch," the two girls replied at
once. "Won't be back until two o'clock."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear!" I fretted. Then a third girl spoke up.</p>

<p>"Let's have a look at that wire, dear, will you?"
she said to the parcels girl. "I think I remember Miss
Carfax taking this in. Yes. That's right. 'Why ever
don't you send my clothes, Miss Million?' I remember
us passing the remark afterwards what an uncommon
name 'Million' was."</p>

<p>"Oh, do you! How splendid!" I said, all eagerness
at once. "Then you remember the young lady who
telegraphed?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A small, rather stumpy young lady," I pursued.
"Nice-looking, with bright grey eyes and black hair?
She was dressed in a cerise evening frock with a&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The post-office girl shook her head behind the wire
screen.</p>

<p>"No; that wasn't the one."</p>

<p>"How stupid of me; no, of course, she wouldn't
be still wearing the evening frock," I amended hastily.
"But she was dark-haired, and short&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Again the post-office girl shook her head.</p>

<p>"Shouldn't call her short," she said. "Taller than
me."</p>

<p>"Dark, though," I insisted. "Black hair."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said the post-office girl decidedly. "That
wasn't her. Red hair. Distinctly red."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;222]</span>
"Are you sure," I said, in dismay, "that you haven't
made a mistake?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said the post-office girl, still more decidedly.
"I've seen her about, often. I know the colour
of her hair. You know, Daisy," turning to another of
the girls, "that one from the 'Refuge.'"</p>

<p>"There's so many from the 'Refuge' come in here,"
said the maddening girl she had called Daisy.</p>

<p>"Yes, but you know the one. Rather strikingly
dressed always. Lots of scent, makes herself up. Her
with the hair. The one we call 'Autumn Tints.'"</p>

<p>"'Autumn Tints'&mdash;oh, yes, I know her&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, we know her," chorused the other girls, while
I fidgeted, crumpling Million's baffling wire in my hand.
"That's the lady who sent off the telegram. I couldn't
be mistaken."</p>

<p>Mr. Hiram P. Jessop, at my side, interposed.</p>

<p>"Well, now, will you young ladies be so kind as to
tell us where she resides? The 'Refuge'&mdash;what'll that
be?"</p>

<p>We had, it seemed, still some distance to go. We
must take the road that went so, then turn to the right,
then to the left again. Then about a mile further down
we'd see a red brick house in a clump of trees, with a
big garden and green palings on to the road. It had
"The Refuge" painted up on a board nailed to a big
oak tree in the garden. We shouldn't be able to mistake
it, said the girls.</p>

<p>"Certainly you won't mistake it if you see any of
the 'Refugees' in the garden when you come up," hazarded
the most talkative of the post-office girls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;223]</span>
"It's a case of 'Once seen, never to be forgotten,'
there!"</p>

<p>As we went out of the office I found myself wondering
more and more anxiously what all this might mean.
What sort of a place had Million got herself into the
middle of?</p>

<p>"What do you think it all means?" I turned again
appealingly to the young man who was driving me.</p>

<p>He shook his grey-hatted head. His face was rather
graver than before.</p>

<p>Mercy! What were we going to find? What did he
think? Evidently he wasn't going to tell me.</p>

<p>Only when we got clear of the straggling outskirts of
Lewes he crammed on speed. Up the gradual hills we
flew between the bare shoulders of the downs where the
men and horses working in the fields afar off looked as
small as mechanical toys. The whole country was gaunt
and gigantic, and a little frightening, to me. Perhaps
this was because my nerves were already utterly overstrained
and anxious. I could see no beauty in the wideswept
Sussex landscape, with the little obsolete-looking
villages set down here and there, like a child's building
of bricks, in the midst of a huge carpet.</p>

<p>There seemed to me something uncanny and ominous
in the tinkling of the sheep-bells that the fresh breeze
allowed to drift to our ears.</p>

<p>On we whizzed, and by what miracle we escaped police-traps
I do not know.... We took the turns of our
directions, and at last I heard a short, relieved sort of
exclamation from Mr. Hiram P. Jessop.</p>

<p>"Here we are. This'll be it, I guess." For here
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;224]</span>
were the dark-green towers of elms set back from the
road. A red roof and old-fashioned chimney-stacks
showed among them. There was a garden in front, with
tall Mary-lilies and pink-and-white phlox and roses and
carnations and thrift that grew down to the palings.</p>

<p>And close up beside those palings there was drawn
a pale-blue car that I knew well&mdash;too well!</p>

<p>It was the car with the silver-winged Victory as
mascot! The car in which we'd been followed and
shadowed for so much of our journey by the Honourable
Jim Burke.</p>

<p>He was here, then! He was before us!</p>

<p>What had he to do with the "Refuge"?</p>

<p>Sounds of singing greeted us as we left the car,
pushed open the green-palinged gate, and walked up
the pebbled path between the flower-beds of the garden.
Some one behind the lilac bushes was singing, in a very
clear, touching voice, a snatch of the ballad: "Oh, ye'll
tak' the high road and I'll tak' the low road, and I'll
be in Scotland before ye...."</p>

<p>A turn in the garden path brought us full upon the
singer. A wonderful apparition indeed she was! As
tall as any woman I had seen (excepting the long-limbed
cobra-lady), and the June sun shone on a head
of hair that was as bright as a bed of marigolds&mdash;red
hair, but not all the same kind of red. It was long
and loose in the breeze, and it fell to the singer's waist
in a shower of red-gold, covering her face and hiding
most of her bodice, which appeared to be a sort of
flimsy muslin dressing-jacket. Her skirt was very
makeshift and of brown holland. The stockings she
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;225]</span>
wore were white thread, and her shoes were just navy-blue
felt bedroom slippers, with jaeger turn-overs to
them. In fact, her whole appearance was négligée in
the extreme. Who&mdash;what could she be? She looked a
cross between a mermaid and a scarecrow. She was
holding one hank of red-gold out against her arm, as
a shop assistant measures silk, and she crunched along
the garden path, still singing in that delicious voice:
"But I and my true love will never meet again, on the
bonny, bonny banks of Loch Lomond!" Blinded by
her hair and the stream of sunlight, she nearly walked
straight into us before she discovered that there was
any one there on the path at all.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," began Mr. Hiram P. Jessop
with his usual politeness. "Could you inform us&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The singing mermaid gave a little "ow" of consternation,
and tossed back some of the hair from her
face.</p>

<p>It was a disappointing sight, rather, for what we saw
was a round, full-mooney, rather foolish face, with a
large pink mouth, but no other definite features. The
eyes were pale blue, the cheeks were paler pink, and the
eyebrows and eyelashes looked as if they had been
washed away in a shower of rain.</p>

<p>Altogether, a thoroughly weird apparition it was who
stared at us, and giggled, and said, in a very Cockney
accent: "Oh, good Gollywog! another man! There's
no getting away from them in this place this morning.
And there was I thinking I had found a quiet spot to
dry my hair in!"</p>

<p>"I am very sorry to intrude," said Mr. Hiram P.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;226]</span>
Jessop in his most courteous voice. "Could you inform
me, Madam, if this is the house they call The Refuge?"</p>

<p>"That's right," said the woman with the hair. And
I found myself suddenly wondering if she were the lady
that those post-office girls had nicknamed "Autumn
Tints."</p>

<p>It was most appropriate, with those reds and golds
and bronzes of the hair that must have been sufficiently
striking had it not been "treated" with henna, as it
had.</p>

<p>So I said eagerly, and without further preamble:
"Oh, then, could you tell me if Miss Million is here?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't, dear, really," said the woman, who
looked all washed-out excepting her hair. "There is
such a lot of them that keep coming and going here!
Like a blessed beehive, isn't it? Bothered if I can keep
track of all their names!"</p>

<p>She paused a moment before she went on.</p>

<p>"Miss Million&mdash;now which would she be?"</p>

<p>I felt a chill of despair creeping over my heart.</p>

<p>What did she mean by saying that "so many of
them" kept coming and going in this place?</p>

<p>This, combined with the comments of those post-office
girls at Lewes, awoke in my mind one terrifying
conclusion. This place with the peaceful garden and
the pretty name&mdash;&mdash;! There was something uncanny
about it.... This place was a lunatic asylum!</p>

<p>Yes, I did not see what else on earth it could possibly
be! And then this woman with the vacuous face
and the wild hair, and still wilder kind of attire, she,
without doubt, was one of the patients!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;227]</span>
What in the world was my poor little Million doing
in this galley, provided she was here at all?</p>

<p>And who brought her here? And what was the
Honourable Jim's car doing out there? Could he have been
so disgraceful as to have got her brought here for the
purpose of rescuing her himself, and of earning her
undying gratitude as well as the riches of her uncle?
Oh, what a horrible trick....</p>

<p>Rather than that I felt that I would gladly see the
money all go over to Miss Million's cousin! That big
young man stood there looking as puzzled as I did,
glancing doubtfully, almost apprehensively, at the
woman with the wild attire.</p>

<p>I attacked her again, with more firmness this time.</p>

<p>"I think Miss Million must be here," I said. "She
sent me a telegram, and they told me at the post-office
place that it was&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh! her that sent the telegram, was it? That's
the young lady you want? I know, I took the telegram
myself," said the woman with the autumn-foliage hair.
"It was a girl who turned up here with nothing but
an evening gown and a light coat the day before yesterday;
a dark girl, short."</p>

<p>"That would be the one," I cried with the utmost
eagerness. "Is she&mdash;&mdash;Oh, is she still here?"</p>

<p>"She's here, all right," said the woman with the hair.
"My word! She wasn't half in a paddy, I can tell
you, because she could not get her maid or whoever it
was to send down her things from London. Nothing
but what she stood up in, and having to borrow, and
no one with a thing to fit her! She is here, all right!"
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;228]</span>
Relieved, but not completely relieved until I should have
heard more of Million's adventures, I said: "I am
her maid. I have brought down her things. Would
you be so kind as to tell me where I should find Miss
Million?"</p>

<p>"She will be in the house, having her dinner now,"
said the poor red-haired lunatic quite kindly. "You
will excuse me coming in with you myself, dear, won't
you? There is a strange gentleman in there come in
that other car, and I have not had time to go and get
myself dressed yet. I made sure I should have all the
morning to myself to get my hair done. Such a time it
does take me," she added, shaking it out with an air
of vanity, and, indeed, she had something to be vain of.
"It isn't everybody I like to see me like this. I am never
one to be careless about my appearance when there are
gentlemen about. They never think any more of a girl"
(poor creature, she was at least forty) "for things of
that kind. I am sure I had no more idea that there was
another gentleman coming in, and me with my hair like
this! Of course, as I always say, well! it's my own
hair! Not like some girls that have to have a haystack
on their heads before they're fit to look at, as well as a
switch all round...."</p>

<p>It really seemed as if she was going on with this
"mildly mental" chatter for as long as we chose to
listen.</p>

<p>So I gave one glance at Miss Million's cousin, meaning,
"Shall we go?" He nodded gravely back at me.
Then, leaving the red-haired lunatic on the path, shaking
her tresses in the sun, we went on between the lilac
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;229]</span>
bushes with their undergrowth of lilies and stocks and
pinks until we came to the house.</p>

<p>The house was a regular Sussex farm sort of looking
place that had evidently been turned into a more modern
dwelling-house place. There were bright red curtains
at all the white-sashed windows, which were wide
open. There were window-boxes with lobelia and
canary-creeper and geraniums. As I say, all the
windows were flung wide open, and from out of them I
heard issuing such a babble of mixed noises as I don't
think I had ever heard since I was last in the parrot-house
at the Zoo. There were shrill voices talking;
there was clattering of knives and forks against crockery.
These sounds alternated with such bursts of
unrestrained laughter that now I was perfectly certain
that my suspicion outside in the garden had been a
correct one. Yes! This place could be nothing but
some institution for the mentally afflicted.</p>

<p>And this&mdash;and this was where Million had been
spirited off to!</p>

<p>Setting my teeth, and without another glance at the
increasingly grave face of my companion, I ran up the
two shallow stone steps to the big open front door, and
rang the bell. The tinkling of it was quite drowned
by the bursts of hysterical merriment that was issuing
from the door on the left of us.</p>

<p>"They can't hear us through that Bedlam," was Mr.
Jessop's very appropriate comment. "See here, Miss
Smith, as it appears to be mostly ladies I shan't be
wanted, I guess. Supposing you go easy into the porch
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;230]</span>
and knock on that door while I wait out here on the
steps?"</p>

<p>This I did.</p>

<p>I knocked hard in my desperation. No answer but
fresh bursts of laughter, fresh volumes of high-pitched
talk. Suddenly I seemed to catch through it a deep-voiced
masculine murmur with an intonation that I
knew&mdash;the caressing Irish inflection of Mr. James
Burke.</p>

<p>"What divilment is he up to now, I wonder?" I
thought exasperatedly, and my annoyance at the very
thought of that man nerved me to knock really peremptorily
on the sturdy panels of the door.</p>

<p>Then at last I got an answer.</p>

<p>"Don't stand knocking there like an idiot, come in,"
shrieked the highest-pitched of all the parrot voices.
Giving myself a mental shake, in I went.</p>

<p>I found myself in a big brown distempered room,
with a long white table running down the centre of it.
The place seemed full to overflowing with two elements&mdash;one,
the overpowering smell of dinner, i. e., pork and
greens and boiled potatoes, and stout; two, a crowd of
girls and women who looked to me absolutely numberless.
They were all more or less pretty, these girlish
faces. And they were all turned to me with wide-open
eyes and parted lips. Out of this sea of faces there
appeared to be just two that I recognised as I gazed
round. One was the laughing, devil-may-care face of
the Honourable Jim, who sat with a long peg glass in
front of him, at the bottom of the table.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<h3>FOUND!</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> other&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Ah, yes! At last, at last! After all my anxiety and
worry and fretting and search! There she was! I
could have kissed the small, animated grey-eyed face of
the girl who was sitting next to the Honourable Jim at
the table. However she'd come there, I had at least
found her.</p>

<p>My long-lost mistress; Miss Million herself!</p>

<p>"Oh, it's her!" cried Miss Million's shrill Cockney
voice in a sudden cessation of the parrot-like shrieks
of talk and laughter as I ran round the table. "Oh,
it's my Miss&mdash;it's my Miss Smith!"</p>

<p>She clapped her hands with impatience, jumping up
in her chair.</p>

<p>"Have you brought them, Smith?" she demanded
eagerly. "Have you got my clothes&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, 'ark at her!" shrieked some one on the right
of the table. "It's all her clothes! Hasn't thought of
anything else since she came down&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Better late than never&mdash;&mdash;" The babble went on
all around me, while I strove to make myself heard.</p>

<p>"Now we shall see a bit o' style&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't see anything wrong with the blouse the girl's
got on, myself&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Fits where it touches, doesn't it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Indeed, the garment in which my young mistress's
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;232]</span>
small form was enfolded appeared to be the sort of
wrap which a hairdresser's assistant tucks about one
when one is going to have a shampoo!</p>

<p>"Looks like a purser's jacket on a marling-spike!"
sang out some one else; and then more laughter.</p>

<p>Well, if they were lunatics, they were at least the
cheerful variety!</p>

<p>I went up to Miss Million's chair, ignoring the blue
glance of the man beside her, and said in my "professional,"
respectful murmur: "I have brought your
dressing-bag and a suit-case, Miss&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why ever didn't you bring them down yesterday?"
demanded Million, all eyes and shrill Cockney accent.</p>

<p>"I didn't know, Miss, where I was to bring them,"
I replied, feeling the amused gaze of the Honourable
Jim upon me as I said it.</p>

<p>"But, bless me! I gave the full address," vociferated
Miss Million, "in that telegram!"</p>

<p>All the lunatics (or whatever they were) were also
listening with manifest enjoyment.</p>

<p>"There was no address, Miss," I said, as I handed
her the wire, which I still kept in my hand.</p>

<p>"Yes! But this was the second one I sent!" protested
my mistress loudly. "This was when I was at
my wit's end and couldn't think why you didn't come!
I sent off that first one first thing in the morning; you
ought to have got it!"</p>

<p>"I never did, Miss," I began.</p>

<p>Then a robust, rollicking voice that I confusedly remembered
broke in on the discussion.</p>

<p>"There you are, you see! What do I always say?
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;233]</span>
Never trust anything except your lookin'-glass, and not
that except it's in a cross light," cried the voice gaily.
"Certainly don't trust anything with trousers on!
Not even if they are ragged ones and tied up with
lumps of string! Not even if they do pitch you a tale
about having served in the Boer War!"</p>

<p>Still feeling as if I were in a weird dream, I turned
towards the direction of the voice that enunciated these
puzzling sentiments.</p>

<p>It proceeded from&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Ah! I knew her, too!</p>

<p>I knew the brass-bright hair and the plump white-clad,
sulphur-crested, cockatoo-like form across the
table.</p>

<p>"London's Love," again! Miss Vi Vassity herself!
I'd seen her last where I last saw Million&mdash;at that supper-table....
Now what in the world was England's
premier comedienne doing in this asylum&mdash;if an asylum
it were?</p>

<p>She went on in her high swift voice. "You won't
catch me giving half-crowns to any more tramps to
hand in a wire at the next post-office! No! Not if they
can sport a row of medals on their chests from here to
East Grinstead! I knew how it would be," declared
Miss Vi Vassity. "My kind heart's my downfall,
but I'm going to sign the pledge to reform that. And
you, my dear&mdash;&mdash;"&mdash;to me&mdash;</p>

<p>"You sit down and have a bite of something to eat
with us. Your mistress don't mind. You don't mind,
Nellie, do you?"&mdash;this to Miss Million.</p>

<p>"We all mess together in this place. I couldn't be
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;234]</span>
worried with a servant's hall. Make room for her
there, Irene, will you? The girl looks scared to death;
it's all right, Miss&mdash;Smith, aren't you? Sit down, child,
sit down&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Before I could say another word I found that a
wooden chair had been pushed squeakingly under me
by some one. Knives and forks had been clattered
down in front of me by some one else. And there was
I, sitting almost in the lap of a very tiny, dark-eyed,
gipsy-looking girl, in a blouse without a collar and a
pink linen sun hat pulled well down over her small
face.</p>

<p>On the other side of me, a big, lazy-looking blonde
in a sky-blue sports coat rocked her own chair a little
away from mine, and said, in a drowsy, friendly sort
of voice: "Drop of ale, dear? Or d'you take a glasser
stout?"</p>

<p>Then the flood tide of talk and laughter seemed to
flow on over my head so fast that I literally could not
make myself heard. I expostulated that I had already
had lunch, and that I didn't want anything to drink,
thanks, and that a gentleman was waiting outside on
the step&mdash;but it passed unheeded until my hostess
caught my eye.</p>

<p>"What's that, what's that?" ejaculated Miss Vi
Vassity, preening her white-linen-bedecked bust across
the table, as she saw me trying vainly to say something
against the uproar. "What's all that disturbance in
the dress circle, Bella?" The honey-blonde whom she
called Bella turned to me and said: "Speak up, dear;
no one can hear your lines!" Then she made a trumpet
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;235]</span>
of her plump white hands and bellowed across to
Miss Vi Vassity:</p>

<p>"Says she's got her best boy with her, and that he is
having to wait outside on the steps!"</p>

<p>Here there was another general gale of laughter, in
which my crimson-cheeked explanations were quite lost!
In the middle of it all I saw the Honourable Jim rise
from his seat, and stride into the hall and bring in Mr.
Jessop. He appeared to be introducing him to London's
Love. Miss Vi Vassity immediately made the
new-comer sit down also, close to her at the top of the
table.</p>

<p>I have said it was a rather strange lunch that we
had had earlier in the morning at the little honeysuckle-covered
inn, where we three had taken cider and
bread and cheese together. But it was nothing to the
extraordinary unexpectedness, yes, the weirdness in
every way of this second lunch, at the long table lined
with all those strange types.</p>

<p>Already, as I sat down, I had given up the idea
that it was a female lunatic asylum and rest cure combined.
But what was it, this "Refuge"?</p>

<p>I simply couldn't think! And I did not find out until
quite a long time afterwards. After dinner was finished,
when Million, I knew, was fuming for her boxes,
she beckoned me to follow her away from the noisy
crowd of girls, up the shallow, broad, old-fashioned
staircase. There was one door on the landing which
she tiptoed past, putting her finger on her lips.</p>

<p>More mystery!</p>

<p>I could hardly wait with my questions until the door
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;236]</span>
was shut of the little, slanting-ceiling room with the
snow-white, dimity-covered bed that represented Miss
Million's new quarters.</p>

<p>There were straw mats on the bare boards. On the
little chest of drawers there was a Jubilee mug full of
the homeliest cottage flowers. This was a far cry from
London and the Hotel Cecil!</p>

<p>I turned with eagerness to my mistress. She had
flung herself upon the suit-case that had now been
brought up to her room. She had forgotten to wait
until I should unpack for her, and, having snatched the
keys from me, she began fishing out her blouses and
other possessions with "Ah's" of delight and recognition.</p>

<p>"What on earth is this place, and what's the meaning
of it all?" I began. But Miss Million laughed gleefully,
evidently taking no small delight in my mystification.
"Lively, isn't it?" she said. "Talk about
the old orphanage! Well, us girls used to enjoy life
there, but it was a fool to this. I fair revel in it, I
can tell you, Smith, and be bothered to the old Cecil.
I don't see why we shouldn't stop on here. Middle-day
dinner and all. That's just my mark, and we can
wire to that other place. Here's plenty good enough
for me, for the present&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But, look here," I began. "I want to know&mdash;&mdash;"
My mistress took me up quickly. I hadn't seen her
in such bubbling high spirits since some of the old
kitchen-days at Putney. "It's me that 'wants to
know,' and I'm just going to begin asking questions
about it," she declared, as she jumped up to allow
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;237]</span>
me to fasten her into the skirt of the tobacco-brown
taffeta.</p>

<p>"Look here, for a start! Who's that nice-lookin'
young fellow you came down with? I never! Motorin'
all over the country with strange young gentlemen. My
word! there's behaviour!" giggled Million, evidently
with the delightful consciousness that her own behaviour
was far more reprehensible than mine could ever be.
"Bringin' him in, as bold as brass; whatever do you
think your Auntie'd say to that, Miss&mdash;there! I nearly
called you Miss Beatrice again. After all this time!
Thinkin' of your Aunt Nasturtium, I suppose? But
straight ... Smith! Where did you pick up that
young man?"</p>

<p>"Pick him up? I didn't," I began, feeling that a
long explanation was ahead of me. "As a matter of
fact, he picked me up&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, shockin'," said Million, giggling more than before.
"Whoever said I was going to allow you to have
followers?"</p>

<p>This annoyed me.</p>

<p>"Followers!" I exclaimed quite violently.</p>

<p>It really was exasperating. First the Honourable
Jim! Then the girl called "Bella"! Then my mistress!
They were all taking it for granted! They
were all foisting him upon me, this young American with
the sleek, mouse-coloured hair and the upholstered
shoulders! Upon me!</p>

<p>"His name is Mr. Hiram P. Jessop&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"'Tain't pretty, but what's in a name?" said Million,
as she held out her wrist for me to insert the microscopic
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;238]</span>
pearl buttons into the fairy-silk loops that fastened
her cuffs. "Who is he?"</p>

<p>"He's your cousin," I told her.</p>

<p>And, of course, as I expected, it was some time before
I was able to get my young mistress to believe this.</p>

<p>"You're sure," she said at last, "that he's not
having us on?"</p>

<p>"I don't think so," I said rather sadly, for I thought
again of what that cousinship might mean&mdash;the loss of
all Miss Million's fortune! However, I'd leave that
aspect of it for the present. Let him explain that.
They hadn't been introduced yet.</p>

<p>I said: "He's extremely anxious to meet you, let
me tell you. He thought of nothing else all the time
that he was talking to me. Be as nice to him as you
can, won't you?"</p>

<p>"Well, I don't see why I should go out of my way,"
demurred Million exasperatingly. I had hoped that
she might appeal to the chivalrous side of the young
American's nature; appeal to it so that he might give
up his idea of fighting for his rights&mdash;if they are his
rights! But if Million is going to put her back up and
become independent&mdash;well, they'll fight. And there'll
be a catastrophe, and the downfall of Million's prosperity,
and general wretchedness for Miss Million and
her maid&mdash;oh, dear, what a prospect!</p>

<p>I began to coax her.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, be nice. He's rather a dear, this cousin
of yours. And he was so absurdly pleased, do you
know, to hear that you had black hair. He admires
brunettes."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;239]</span>
"Very kind of him," said Million quite flippantly.
"You told him, I suppose, about me bein' dark."</p>

<p>"He asked so many questions!" I said. "He really
takes such an interest. You ought to be flattered, Miss
Million."</p>

<p>"I don't know that having interest taken in me by
young gentlemen is any such a rarity, just now!"</p>

<p>Here she reddened rather prettily.</p>

<p>I fastened the other cuff. Million went on, in a
gush of artless confidence: "To tell you the truth,
Smith, I haven't half been getting off lately. The
other night, at the Thousand and One Club, who d'you
suppose was making a fuss of me? A lord, my
girl!"</p>

<p>This she said, little dreaming that her maid had
watched the whole of this scene.</p>

<p>"And then, there's something else that's getting a
bit more serious," said Million, bridling. "Turning up
to-day, just because he'd guessed where I'd got to, and
all!"</p>

<p>"He? Which he?" I asked, with a quick feeling of
dismay.</p>

<p>"It's what I call pointed," said Million, "the way
he's been going on ever since he's met me. Even if
he is uncle's old friend, it's not all on account of uncle
that he makes hisself so agreeable. Oh, no! Marked,
that's what I call it. You know who I mean."</p>

<p>She nodded her dark head. She smiled as she spoke
the name with a shyness that suited her rather well.</p>

<p>"The Honourable Mr. Burke!"</p>

<p>"Million!" I said anxiously, as I folded the borrowed
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;240]</span>
blouse I'd taken off her, "Miss Million, do you
like him?"</p>

<p>Miss Million's grey eyes sparkled. She said: "Who
wouldn't like him?"</p>

<p>A pang seized me. A pang of the old apprehension
that my little heiress of a mistress might lose
her heart to a graceless fortune-hunter!</p>

<p>I said, with real anxiety in my tone: "Oh, my dear,
you don't think you are going to fall in love with this
Mr. Burke, do you?"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>

<h3>MISS MILLION IN LOVE</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">At</span> last I have been allowed to get to the bottom of
what this extraordinary place, the "Refuge," really is!</p>

<p>It is no more a lunatic asylum, of course, than it is
a nunnery.</p>

<p>It started life by being a big Sussex farmhouse.</p>

<p>Then some truly enterprising person took it on as
a lodging-house for summer visitors, also for a tea-garden
for motorists.</p>

<p>Then it happened that England's premier comedienne,
Miss Vi Vassity, who was motoring through on
her way from a week-end at Brighton, saw the place.
She fell in love with it as the fulfilment of one of her
dreams.</p>

<p>It appeared that she has always wanted to set up a
lodging-house for hard-up theatrical girls who are what
they call "resting," that is, out of a job for the moment.</p>

<p>I have picked up from Million and from the others
that London's Love has the kindest heart in all London
for those members of her profession who have been
less successful than she has. She has a hundred pensioners;
she is simply besieged with begging-letters. It
is a wonder that there is any of her own salary left
for this bright-haired, sharp-tongued artiste to live on!</p>

<p>Well, to cut a long story short, she bought the place.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;242]</span>
Here it is, crammed full of stage girls and women of
one sort and another, mostly from the music-halls. The
woman with the hair is Miss Alethea Ashton, the
"serio." The honey-blonde in the dressing-jacket, who
sat at one side of me at dinner, is "Marmora, the
Twentieth Century Hebe," who renders classic poses or
"breathing marbles."</p>

<p>The tiny, gipsy-looking one on my other side is Miss
Verry Verry, the boy impersonator, who appears in
man-o'-war suits and sailor hats. There is a snake-charmer
lady and a ventriloquist's assistant, and I have
not yet been able to discover who all the others
were.</p>

<p>Miss Vi Vassity lets those pay her who can. The
others owe "until their ship comes in"; but the mistress
of the place keeps a shrewd though kindly eye on
all their doings, and she comes down at least once a
week herself to make sure that all is well with "Refuge"
and "Refugettes."</p>

<p>The secret of her sudden pilgrimage into Sussex
the other night was that she had received a telephone
message at the club of The Thousand and One Nights
to inform her of still another arrival at the "Refuge."
This was the infant daughter of the ventriloquist's assistant,
who is also the ventriloquist's wife. This event
seems to have come off some weeks before it was expected.
And at the time the "Refuge" was short of
domestic service; there was no one to wait on the nurse
who had been hastily summoned. The house was at
sixes and sevens....</p>

<p>In a fever of hurry Miss Vi Vassity went down, taking
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;243]</span>
with her a volunteer who said she loved little babies
and would do anything to "be a bit of a help" in the
house.</p>

<p>This volunteer was the little heiress, who still kept,
under all her new and silken splendour, the heart of
the good-natured, helpful "little Million" from the
Soldiers' Orphanage and the Putney kitchen.</p>

<p>I might have spared myself all my nervous anxiety
about Lord Fourcastles! It seems a bad dream now.</p>

<p>She had motored off then and there with the head
of the "Refuge," without even waiting to wire from
town. Only when they neared their destination had
she thought of sending off a message to me, with the
address where I was to follow her. That message had
probably been tossed into the hedgerow by the tramp
to whom it had been hastily entrusted.</p>

<p>Hence my anxiety and suspense, which Miss Million
declared had been nothing compared to her own!</p>

<p>Of course, people who have given terrible frights
to their friends always insist upon it that it is they
who have been the frightened ones!</p>

<p>But all this, of course, was what I picked up by degrees,
and in incoherent patches, later on.</p>

<p>Many things had happened before I really got to
the rights of the story. One scene after another has
been flicked on to the screen of my experiences ...
but to take things in order.</p>

<p>Perhaps I had better go back to where I was unpacking
Million's things in the transformed farmhouse
bedroom, and where I was confronted with a fresh
anxiety.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;244]</span>
Namely, that the wealthy and ingenuous and inexperienced
Million really had fallen in love with that
handsome ne'er-do-weel, Mr. James Burke.</p>

<p>"Have you?" I persisted. "Have you?"</p>

<p>Million gave a little admitting sigh. She sat there
on the edge of the dimity bed, and watched me shake
out that detested evening frock in which she had motored
down.</p>

<p>She has got it so crumpled that I shall make it the
excuse never to let her wear it again.</p>

<p>"The Honourable Mr. Burke," said Million, with a
far-away look in her eyes, "is about the handsomest
gentleman that I have ever seen."</p>

<p>"I daresay," I said quite severely. "Certainly there
is no denying the Honourable Jim's good looks. Part
of his stock-in-trade! But you know, Miss Million"&mdash;here
I brought out the eternal copy-book maxim&mdash;"Handsome
is as handsome does!"</p>

<p>Hereupon Million voiced the sentiment that I had
always cherished myself concerning that old proverb.</p>

<p>"It may be true. But then, it always seems to me,
somehow, as if it was neither here nor there!"</p>

<p>I didn't know what to say. It seemed so very evident
that Million had set her innocent and affectionate
heart on a young man who was good-looking enough
in his Celtic, sooty-haired, corn-cockle, blue-eyed way,
but who really had nothing else to recommend him.
Everything to be said against him, in fact. Insincere,
unscrupulous, cynical, unreliable; everything that's
bad, bad, <span class="smcap">BAD</span>!</p>

<p>"You can't say he isn't a gentleman, now," put in
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;245]</span>
Million again, with a defiant shake of her little dark
head. "That you can't say."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know. It depends," I said, in a very
sermonising voice. "It all depends upon what you call
'a gentleman.'"</p>

<p>"No, it doesn't," contradicted Miss Million unexpectedly.
"You know yourself it doesn't depend upon
'what you call' anything. Either he is, or he isn't.
That Auntie of yours would ha' told you that. And
stuck-up and stand-offish and a perfect terror as she
was, she'd have been the first to admit that the Honourable
Mr. Burke was one of her own sort!"</p>

<p>I couldn't help smiling a little. Million had hit it.
This would have been exactly Aunt Anastasia's attitude!</p>

<p>"And don't you remember what my great wish always
was? Whenever there was a new moon, or anything,"
Million reminded me, "you used to want money and
nice clothes. But there was something I wanted&mdash;quite
different. I wanted to marry a gentleman. I&mdash;I still
want it!"</p>

<p>Her underlip quivered as she gazed out of the lattice-window
at the peaceful bare Sussex landscape. Her
grey eyes were full of tears and of dreams. As for me,
I felt half-sorrowful for her, half-furious with the Hon.
Jim; the person whom nobody but a perfect innocent,
like Million, would dream of liking or taking seriously!...
Reprobate! He ought to be horsewhipped!</p>

<p>I remembered his whimsical horror in that tea-shop
when he had exclaimed to me: "Marry her? Marry a
girl with hands like that, or a voice like that?" Yet he
had made "a girl with a voice like that" dreamily in
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;246]</span>
love with him. Really my heart swelled quite passionately
with resentment against him.</p>

<p>I wondered how far he had been trifling with her
honest heart, both yesterday night at the Thousand and
One Club, and this morning at lunch at the "Refuge."
He was quite capable of doing one of two despicable
things. Either of flirting desperately and then riding
away; or, of marrying her in spite of what he had said,
and then neglecting everything about her but her income!
Which was he going to do, I wondered.</p>

<p>"Million! Miss Million," I said hastily. "Do you
mind telling me if Mr. Burke has proposed to you?"</p>

<p>Million looked down, showing the dark half-moons
of her eyelashes on her cheeks in a way that I knew
she had copied from one of the "Cellandine Novelettes"
which used to be her favourite reading in Putney. She
heaved a deep sigh. And then she said: "Well! Between
you and I, he hasn't spoken yet."</p>

<p>"Yet? Do you mean&mdash;do you think he is going to?"
I said sharply.</p>

<p>A smile grew over Million's small and bonny face.
I must say I think she grows better-looking every day.
Why should the Honourable Jim have made that unkind
remark about her hands? Her face is prettier, probably,
than those of half the wealthy girls he meets.
Especially when she dimples like that.</p>

<p>She said demurely: "Do you know, I don't think
any one can expect any one not to notice when any
one is getting really fond of any one!"</p>

<p>This involved sentence meant, I knew, the worst.</p>

<p>It meant that she thought the Honourable Jim was
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;247]</span>
going to ask her to marry him! And she must have
some good reason for thinking so! Or he's an incorrigible
flirt, one of the two!</p>

<p>"If he does ask you to marry him," I pursued, feeling
as if I were a mixture of a schoolmistress and Million's
own mother combined, "do you think you are
going to say yes you will?"</p>

<p>"Do I think?" echoed Million ardently. "I don't
'think' anything about it. I just know I will!"</p>

<p>Oh, dear! Ever since I have been Miss Million's
maid I have seemed to get from one difficulty into another.
It is worse than ever now that I know for certain
that the poor little thing imagines she is going
to marry Mr. Burke. She won't ever be happy, even
if he does marry her for her money.</p>

<p>But, stop! There is another thing. Her money?</p>

<p>Supposing her money does go? Well, then, the
handsome Irishman will jilt her quite mercilessly. I
know enough about him to know that! And I have a
horrible presentiment that this is exactly what is going
to happen. That shrewd-eyed young American downstairs,
Mr. Hiram P. Jessop, will bring an action to
recover for himself all Miss Million's dollars. He will
walk off with the fortune. And my mistress, poor little
creature, will be left without either money or love!</p>

<p>As for me, I shall lose my place. I, too, shan't know
what to do&mdash;unless&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Oh, yes. There is always one thing I can do. I shall
marry. There is the proposal of Mr. Reginald Brace,
who begged me to say yes to him when he gets back
from Paris.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;248]</span>
Thinking over it, I am pretty sure that that is what
I shall say.</p>

<p>Really it will be a rest to turn to something as
simple and straightforward as Mr. Reginald Brace
after all the complications with which my life has been
beset up till now. So that disposes of me, Beatrice
Lovelace. But what about Nellie Million?</p>

<p>All these reflections passed through my mind in Million's
bedroom at the "Refuge," all the time I was
putting the finishing touches to her before she went
down to meet her cousin (and incidentally the man who
was going to rob her of her fortune), Mr. Hiram P.
Jessop.</p>

<p>Well, she looked bonny enough to make him feel
some compunction about it, that I would say! The
brown taffeta skirt and the new blouse, the leaf-brown
suède shoes and the silk stockings that I had brought
down with me, all suited her admirably.</p>

<p>And besides being becomingly dressed, there was
something still more potently attractive about Million's
appearance.</p>

<p>It was that flush and glow and sparkle, that aura
that seems to cling about a woman in love. I had
heard before that there is no beauty culture in the
world that can give a woman just that look and that
it is absolutely the most unfailing beautifier. Now I
saw with my own dismayed eyes that it was but too
true.</p>

<p>Nellie Million, ex-maid-of-all-work, had fallen in
love with Lord Ballyneck's graceless younger son. The
result, so far, was to improve her looks as much as my
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;249]</span>
hairdressing and the Bond Street shopping for her
had done already.</p>

<p>She was impatient to go down. This, I knew, was
not on the new cousin's account. Poor child, she wanted
to rejoin the Honourable Jim!</p>

<p>"But you've got to come with me, Smith, you know,"
she said, as she reached the door. "Yes, you have.
You have got to introduce me, and be bothered to your
only being my lady's-maid! There isn't much of that
sort of thing at the 'Refuge,' as I can tell you. See
how nice and homely Vi Vassity was about having you
sit down with all of us at dinner?"</p>

<p>I suppressed a smile at the idea of this condescension.</p>

<p>"Besides, he seems to know you pretty well, does
my cousin," said little Miss Million. "And I tell you,
Smith, you may be very useful. Talking to him and
keeping him out of the way when Mr. Burke might
want to be having a few words with me, do you see?"</p>

<p>I saw, and my heart sank with dismay. There were
fearful complications ahead. I saw myself later on with
Miss Million sobbing over a world that had crashed
into disillusionment just as one of my Aunt Anastasia's
priceless Nankin bowls had once come to pieces in her
hand!</p>

<p>Still, I thought, I had better go down and see with
my own eyes as much of the tragedy as it was possible.
I thought that the first act of it might be even rather
humorous. Both these young men trying to talk to
Million at once, and Million herself giving all her attention
to the young man who was the least good to her!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;250]</span>
We came down into the sitting-room of the
"Refuge." It seemed furnished chiefly with wicker
chairs, and brilliant houseboat cushions and very
stagey-looking photographs with huge autographs,
put at right angles to everything else. When we came
down to this retreat we found that it was occupied only
by Miss Vi Vassity, leaning back very comfortably in a
deck-chair, and blowing smoke rings from the cigarette
that was fastened into a tiny silver holder, while opposite
to her there was seated, looking very conscientious
and gravely interested, my mistress's American cousin,
Mr. Hiram P. Jessop himself.</p>

<p>"Why, where is Mr. Burke got to?" said Million,
with a note of unmistakable disappointment in her
voice.</p>

<p>I knew that the poor little thing had been overwhelmingly
anxious to show herself off once more befittingly
dressed before the blue, black-lashed eyes that
had last beheld her in somebody else's far too voluminous
garments. "I thought he was still with you, Vi?"</p>

<p>Miss Vi Vassity gave a shrewd, amused laugh.</p>

<p>"Not here, not here, my child!" she quoted lazily.
"Our friend Jim said he had got to push on up to
London. He left plenty of messages and kind loves
and so forth for you. And you needn't go bursting
yourself with anxiety that he won't be turning up here
again before we are any of us much older or younger
(seeing the jobs some of us have got to keep off the
enemy). He'll be down again presently all right.
However, one off, another on. Here is a new boy for
you to play with, Nellie. Says he's a cousin of yours,"
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;251]</span>
with a wave of her cigarette towards Mr. Jessop, who
had now risen to his very Americanly booted feet. "I
believe it's true, too," rattled on Miss Vassity. "He
looks to me altogether too wide awake to work off an
old wheeze like 'cousins' if it were not a true one.
Well, cheery-oh, children. I am just off to see if poor
Maudie upstairs has had her gruel. I will leave you to
fall into each other's arms. Come along, Miss Smith.
I daresay I can get that nurse to let you have a look at
the new little nipper if you are keen."</p>

<p>I had been standing all this time, of course, examining
the photographs inscribed "Yours to a cinder,
Archie," and "To darling Vi, from her faithful old
pal, Gertie."</p>

<p>Now I moved quickly towards the door which Miss
Vi Vassity had swung open.</p>

<p>But my mistress, with a quick little movement,
stopped me. "Smith, don't you go. Vi, I don't want
her to go," she protested. "She can pop up and see
that baby afterwards, when it is being bathed. I want
her now to stop and talk to this Mr. Jessop with me.
I shan't feel so nervous then," she added, with her little
giggle.</p>

<p>"Please yourselves," said "London's Love," with a
laugh and a little nod for her exit. We three were left
alone in the sitting-room.</p>

<p>I really think it is wonderful the way Americans will
burst at once into a flood of friendliness that it will
take the average young Englishman at least three or
four years of intimate acquaintance to achieve.</p>

<p>And even then I doubt whether the average young
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;252]</span>
Englishman (take, for example, my prospective fiancé,
Mr. Reginald Brace) would ever be able to "let himself
go" like they do! Never had I heard such a stream
of earnestly spoken compliments, accompanied by
glances of such unmistakable admiration, as young Mr.
Jessop immediately proceeded to lavish on Miss Million.</p>

<p>He told her, if I can remember correctly the sequence
of his remarks: "That he was real delighted to make
her acquaintance; that he had somehow fixed it up in
his mind already that she would be a real, sweet little
girl when he got to know her, and that even he hadn't
calculated what a little Beaut she was going to turn
out&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, listen to him! If it isn't another of them!"
exclaimed the artless Million, all blushes and smiles as
she turned to me; I felt as if I were a referee in some
game of which I wasn't quite certain about the rules.</p>

<p>Mr. Jessop went on to inform his cousin that she had
the real, English, peach-bloom complexion that was so
much admired in the States; only that she did her hair
so much better than the way most English girls seemed
to fix theirs.</p>

<p>Here I nearly dropped a little curtsey. The arrangement
of Million's dark, glossy hair stands to my
credit!</p>

<p>"There's a style about your dressing that I like, too.
So real simple and girlish," approved Mr. Jessop, with
his eyes on the faultlessly cut, tobacco-brown taffeta
that had cost at least four times as much as the elaborately
thought-out crime in cerise which should have
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;253]</span>
been on Million's conscience. "I must say you take my
breath away with your pretty looks, Cousin Nellie;
you do, indeed. If I may say so, you appear to be
the sort of little girl that any one might be thankful
to have to cherish as the regular little queen of the
home."</p>

<p>Hereupon Million glowed as pink as any of the roses
that were spreading their sweetness abroad on the warm
afternoon air outside the gaily curtained window.</p>

<p>"Doesn't that sound lovely!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>There was a wistfulness in her voice. I was afraid
I knew only too well what that wistfulness portended if
I could read Million at all (and I really think I ought
to be able to now). That wistfulness meant "How
much lovelier it would be if the Honourable Jim Burke
had been the one to pay me that compliment about
being the queen of the home!"</p>

<p>Then she added to the young American, whose boyish
eyes were fixed unflinchingly upon her: "Do you know,
I am afraid you are an awful flatterer and deceiver.
You are just trying to see how much I am going to
take in about you thinking me nice-looking and all
that!"</p>

<p>If she could only have had these misgivings about
Mr. Burke himself, instead of their being about the
cousin who, I think, says very little that he does not
really mean! Always the wrong people get credit for
insincerity! "I am not a flatterer, believe me," said
Mr. Hiram P. Jessop. "If you think that I don't mean
anything I say nice to you, why! I am going to be very
sad. I would like to have only nice things to say to
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;254]</span>
you," he added regretfully, "and I tell you it is coming
real hard on me&mdash;harder than I thought it would be,
to have to say the difficult things I have gotten to say
now, Cousin Nellie."</p>

<p>So now he was coming to the business end of the
interview! The part where he meant to tell Million
that her appreciative and gallant cousin was possibly
going to walk off with that fortune of hers!</p>

<p>I rose from my chair. I said respectfully: "Shall I
go, Miss, if Mr. Jessop is going to talk family affairs?"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>

<h3>AN UNUSUAL SORT OF BEGGAR</h3>

<p class="noindent">"<span class="smcap">I guess</span> it's not any different 'business' from what
I have told you, coming along in the car, Miss Smith,"
said the young American simply. "Don't quit on my
account."</p>

<p>"No, nor on mine neither," said Miss Million, turning
quite anxiously to me. "You stop on and hear the
end of this, so that me and you can talk it over like,
later.</p>

<p>"Now, then," turning to her cousin again, "what's
it all about?"</p>

<p>"To cut a long story short," said the young American,
in that earnest way of his that is really rather
lovable. "You see before you, Cousin Nellie, a man who
is"&mdash;he paused impressively before he brought out
half a dozen pregnant words&mdash;"very badly in want of
money!"</p>

<p>"Gracious! I must say I should not have thought
it," ejaculated Million, with a note of the native
shrewdness which I had suspected her of having left
behind in our Putney kitchen. "If you are poor"&mdash;here
her bright grey eyes travelled up her cousin's
appearance from his quite new-looking American
shoes to his well-kept thick and glossy hair&mdash;"if you
are poor, all I can say is your looks don't pity you!"</p>

<p>"I need not point out to you that looks are a very
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;256]</span>
poor proposition to go by when you are starting in on
summing up a person's status," said the young American
easily. "I may not look it, but money is a thing
that I am desperate for."</p>

<p>A sequence of emotions passed each other over Million's
little face. As I watched there were disbelief, impatience,
helplessness, and the first symptoms of yielding.
She said: "Well, I don't know how it is that since
I have come into uncle's money I have been meeting
people one after the other who keep offering to show
me what to do with it. You know, Smith," turning to
me. "Haven't I had a fair bushel of begging letters
from one person and another who is in need of cash?
Some of them was real enough to draw tears from the
eyes of a stone! Do you remember that one, Smith,
about the poor woman with the two babies, and the operation,
and I don't know what all? Well! She dried
up quick since I suggested calling round to see the
babies! A fine take-in that was, I expect"&mdash;this to me,
with her eye on the well-set-up young man sitting before
her. "Still"&mdash;this was where the yielding began to
come in&mdash;"you are my cousin, when all is said. And so,
I suppose, I have got to remember that blood is thicker
than water, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She turned to me.</p>

<p>"Did you bring my cheque-book down, Smith, in my
dressing-bag?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Miss, I did," I said gravely enough, though
I was laughing ruefully within myself.</p>

<p>"Well, just pop upstairs and get it for me," said
Miss Million. Then, again turning to her cousin, she
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;257]</span>
said: "I can't say that I myself would have cared particularly
to start borrowing money off some one the
first time I set eyes on them, cousin or no cousin! Unusual
sort of begging I call it! Still, I daresay I could
spare you" (here I saw her making a rapid mental
calculation) "five pounds, if that is of any good to
you."</p>

<p>Here, at the very door, I stopped. I had been checked
by the hearty laugh of real boyish amusement that
broke from Mr. Hiram P. Jessop at her last words.</p>

<p>"Five pounds!" he echoed in his crisp, un-English
accent. "Five? Any good to me? My dear cousin
Nellie, that's no more good to me than a tissue-paper
sunshade would be under a waterspout. No, five pounds
would be most emphatically not any good to me. Nor
ten pounds. Nor twenty pounds. I am not asking for
a day's carfare and luncheon ticket. I tell you, my
dear little girl, it is <i>money</i> I want!"</p>

<p>Miss Million stared at him rather indignantly this
time. I didn't dream of leaving her at this juncture.</p>

<p>I waited and I watched, without troubling to conceal
my interest from these two young people. I felt I had
to listen to what would happen next.</p>

<p>"Money?" repeated Miss Million, the heiress.
"However much do you want, then?"</p>

<p>"Thousands of dollars," announced the young American
in his grave, sober voice.</p>

<p>There came into the bright grey eyes of Miss Nellie
Million an angry look that I had once seen there when
an unwise milk-boy had tried to convince our thrifty
little maid-of-all-work that he had given her sixpennyworth
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;258]</span>
instead of the bare threepennyworth that filled
the little cardboard vessel which she held in her hand!
For I believe that at the bottom of her heart "little
Million" is still as thrifty, still as careful, still as determined
that she won't be "done"!</p>

<p>In the matter of clothes she has, of course, allowed
herself for once to loose her firmly screwed-on little
dark head.</p>

<p>But now that the trousseau of new clothes is bought
the brief madness had left her. She is again the same
Million who once said to me at home: "Extravagant!
That is a thing I could never be!"</p>

<p>In a voice of the old Million she demanded sharply
of the quite prosperous-looking, well-dressed and well-fed
young man in front of her: "Whatever in the wide
world would you do with all that money, supposing
you had it?"</p>

<p>"Well, I should not waste it, I guess," retorted the
young man. "In fact, it would be put to a considerably
bigger purpose than what it would if you had
kept it, to buy yourself candies and hair-ribbon and
whatever you girls do with money when it gets into
your little hands. I want that money," here his voice
grew more serious than before, "for an Object!"</p>

<p>"I want that money for an object," repeated Miss
Million's American cousin. And then he went on, at
last, to tell us what "the object" was.</p>

<p>It took a long time. It was very complicated. It
was full of technical terms that were absolute Greek to
me, as well as to Million. There she sat in the big
basket-chair, with the coloured cushions behind her
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;259]</span>
dark head; her grey eyes wide open, and fixed, defensively,
upon the face of this young man with a story to
tell.</p>

<p>To cut it short, it was this. About a year ago Mr.
Hiram P. Jessop had left off being manager of the pork
factory belonging to the late Samuel Million because
of his other work. He was, he said, "no factory boss
by nature." He was an inventor. He had invented a
machine&mdash;yes! This was where the technical terms began
raining thick and fast upon our bewildered ears&mdash;a
machine for dropping bombs from aeroplanes&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Bombs? Good heavens alive!" interrupted Miss
Million, with a look of real horror on her little face.
"D'you mean them things that go off?"</p>

<p>"Why, I guess I hope they'd go off," returned the
young man with the shrewd and courteous smile. "Certainly
that would be the idea of them&mdash;to go off! Why,
yes!"</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;are you," said Million, gazing reproachfully
upon him, "one of these here anarchists?"</p>

<p>He shook his mouse-coloured head.</p>

<p>"Do I look like one, Cousin Nellie? Nothing further
from my thoughts than anarchy. The last thing I'd
stand for."</p>

<p>"Then whatever in the wide world d'you want to
go dropping bombs for?" retorted my young mistress.
"Dropping 'em on who, I should like to know?"</p>

<p>"On the enemy, I guess."</p>

<p>"Enemy?"</p>

<p>"Sure thing. I wouldn't want to be dropping them
on our own folks now, would I?" said the young American
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;260]</span>
in his pleasant, reasonable voice; while I, too, gazed
at him in wonder at the unexpected things that came
from his firm, clean-shaven lips.</p>

<p>He began again to explain.</p>

<p>"Now you see, Cousin Nellie and Miss Smith, I am
taking the aeroplane as it will be. Absolutely one of
the most important factors in modern warfare&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But who's talking about war?" asked the bewildered Million.</p>

<p>"I am," said the young American.</p>

<p>"War?" repeated his cousin. "But gracious alive!
Where is there any, nowadays?"</p>

<p>The glimpse of English landscape outside the window
seemed to echo her question.</p>

<p>There seemed to be no memory of such a terrible and
strenuous thing as war among those gently sloping Sussex
Downs, where the white chalk showed in patches
through the close turf, and where the summer haze,
dancing above that chalk, made all the distances deceptive.</p>

<p>From the top of those downs the country, I knew,
must look flat as coloured maps. They lay spread out,
those squares and oblongs of pearl-grey chalk, of green
corn, of golden hay, with "the King's peace over all,
dear boys, the King's peace over all," as Kipling
said.</p>

<p>The whole country seemed as if the events that had
come and gone since the reign, say, of King John had
left no more impression upon it than the cloud shadows
that had rolled and passed, rolled and passed. As it
was in the beginning, so it was in the late June of Nineteen
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;261]</span>
Fourteen. And so it looked as if it must ever
remain.</p>

<p>Yet&mdash;&mdash;Here was an extraordinarily unexpected
young man bringing into the midst of all this sun-lit
peace the talk of war! War as it had never yet been
waged; war not only on the land and under the waves,
but war that dropped death from the very clouds themselves!</p>

<p>"I think you're talking silly," said Miss Million
severely. "No doubt there's always a certain amount
of warring and fighting going on in India, where poor
dad was. Out-of-the-way places like that, where there
aren't any only black people to fight with, anyhow....
But any other sort of fighting came to an end
with the Bo'r War, where dad was outed.</p>

<p>"And I don't see what it's got to do with you, or
why you should think it so fearfully important to go
inventing your bomb-droppers and what-nots for things
what&mdash;what aren't going to happen!"</p>

<p>The young American smiled in a distant sort of
way.</p>

<p>"So you're one of the people that think war isn't
going to happen again? Well! I guess you aren't
lonely. Plenty think as you do," he told his cousin.
"Others think as I do. They calculate that sooner or
later it's bound to come. And that if it comes fortune
will favour those that have prepared for the idea of it.
Aren't you a soldier's daughter, Cousin Nellie?"</p>

<p>The little dark head of Sergeant Million's orphan
went up proudly.</p>

<p>"Rather!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;262]</span>
"Well, then, you'll take a real live interest," said
her cousin, "in something that might make all the difference
in the world to your country, supposing she did
come to grips with another country. That's the difference
that would be made by machines like mine. Not
that there is another machine just like my own, I guess.
Let me tell you about her&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Again he went on talking about his new bomb-dropper
in words that I don't pretend to understand.</p>

<p>I understood the tone, though.</p>

<p>That was unmistakable. It was the rapt and utterly
serious tone which a person speaks in of something that
fills his whole heart. I suppose a painter would speak
thus of his beloved art, or a violinist of his music, or a
mother of her adored and only baby boy. I saw the
young American's face light up until it was even as
something inspired.</p>

<p>This machine of his, for dropping bombs from the
clouds upon the heads of some enemy that existed if
only in his imagination was "his subject." This was
his all. This he lived for. Yes, that was plain to both
of us. I saw Miss Million give an understanding nod
of her little dark head as she said: "Yes, you haven't
half set your mind on this thing, have you?"</p>

<p>"I guess you've hit it," said the American. Then
Miss Million asked: "And where does the money part
of it come in?"</p>

<p>Then he explained to us that, having invented the
thing (it was all a pure joy apparently), now began
the hard work. He had to sell the machine! He had
to get it "taken up," to have it experimented with.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;263]</span>
All this would run him into more money than he had
got.</p>

<p>He concluded simply: "That's where the Million
dollars would come in so useful! And, Cousin Nellie,
I am simply bound to try and get them!"</p>

<p>I watched my mistress's face as he made this announcement.
Miss Million, I saw, was so interested
that for the moment she had forgotten her own obsession,
her infatuation for the Honourable Jim Burke.
As well as the interest, though, there was "fight" in
the grey eyes of the soldier's orphan who used to wear
a blue-print uniform frock and a black straw hat with
a scarlet ribbon about it.</p>

<p>She said: "I see what you mean. Me give you my
money to play with! And what if I don't hold with
investing any of uncle's money in this harum-scarum
idea of yours? I am none so sure that I do hold&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Maybe I might have to do a little of the holding
myself, Cousin Nellie," broke in the quiet, firm voice
of her American cousin. "See here! What if I were
to put up a tussle to get all that money away from
you, whether you wanted to give it up to me to play
with it or not?"</p>

<p>And then he began quickly to explain to her what
he had explained to me coming down in the car. He
went over the possibilities of his contesting Mr. Samuel
Million's will.</p>

<p>I don't think I shall ever forget that funny little
scene in the bungalow-furnished room with all those
theatrical photographs papering the walls, and with
the windows opening on to the Sussex garden where
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;264]</span>
the bees boomed in the roses, and the lazy sound mingled
with the chirping of the starlings, and with the
shriller chatter of two of the "Refuge" girls lying in
deck-chairs in the shadow of the lilacs.</p>

<p>Inside, these two cousins, young American and
young Englishwoman, who might be going to fight for
a fortune, stared at each other with a measuring glance
that was not at all unfriendly. In the eyes of both I
read the same question.</p>

<p>"Now, what are you going to do about it? What
are you going to do about it?"</p>

<p>After a pause Miss Million said: "Well, this'll mean
a lot of worry and noosance, I suppose. Going to
Lawr! Never thought I should come to that sort of
thing. Courts, and lawyers, an' all that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She looked straight at the young American, who
nodded.</p>

<p>"Yes, I guess that's what fighting this thing out
will mean," he agreed.</p>

<p>Miss Million knit her brows.</p>

<p>"Lawr," she said reflectively, voicing the sentiment
of our whole sex on this vexed subject. "Lawr always
seems to be ser <i>silly</i>! It lets a whole lot o' things go
on that you'd think ought to 'a' been stopped hundreds
of years ago by Ack of Parliament. Then again, it
drops on you like one o' them bombs of yours for something
that doesn't make twopennyworth of difference to
anybody, and there you are with forty shillings fine,
at least. An' as for getting anything done with going
to Lawr about it, well, it's like I used to say to the
butcher's boy at Putney when he used to ask me to
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;265]</span>
give him time to get that joint brought round: 'Time!
It isn't time you want, it's Eternity!'</p>

<p>"Going to Lawr! What does it mean? Paying away
pots o' money to a lot o' good-for-nothing people for
talking to you till you're silly, and writing letters to
you that you can't make head nor tail of, and then
nothing settled until you're old and grey. If
then!"</p>

<p>"That's quite an accurate description of my own
feelings towards the business," said the other candidate
for Miss Million's fortune. "I'm not breaking my
neck or straining myself any to hand over to the lawyers
any of the precious dollars that I want for the
wedding-portion of my machine."</p>

<p>"Go to law&mdash;&mdash;No, that's not a thing I want to
do," repeated the present owner of the precious dollars.
"Same time, I'm not going to lose any of the
money that's mine by right if I can possibly keep hold
on it&mdash;that's only sense, that is!"</p>

<p>And she turned to me, while again I felt as if I
were a referee. "What do you say, Smith?"</p>

<p>I was deadly puzzled.</p>

<p>I ventured: "But if you've both made up your minds
you must have the money, there doesn't seem anything
for it but to go to law, does there?"</p>

<p>"Wait awhile," said the young American slowly.
"There does appear to me to be an alternative. Now,
see here&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He leant towards Miss Million. He held out his
hand, as if to point out the alternative. He said:
"There is another way of fixing it, I guess. We needn't
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;266]</span>
fight. I'd feel real mean, fighting a dear little girl like
you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You won't get round me," said Miss Million, quite
as defensively as if she were addressing a tradesman's
boy on a doorstep. "No getting round me with soft
soap, young man!"</p>

<p>"I wasn't meaning it that way," he said, "The
way I meant would let us share the money and yet let's
both have the dollars and the glory of the invention
and everything else!"</p>

<p>"I don't know how you mean," declared Miss Million.</p>

<p>I, sitting there in my corner, had seen what was
coming.</p>

<p>But I really believe Miss Million herself received the
surprise of her life when her cousin gave his quiet reply.</p>

<p>"Supposing," he said, "supposing we two were to
get married?"</p>

<p>"Marry?" cried Miss Million in her shrillest Putney-kitchen
voice. "Me? You?"</p>

<p>She flung up her little, dark head and let loose a
shriek of laughter&mdash;half-indignant laughter at that.</p>

<p>Then, recovering herself, she turned upon the young
man who had proposed to her in this quite unconventional
fashion and began to&mdash;well! there's no expression
for it but one of her own. She began to "go for
him."</p>

<p>"I don't call it very funny," she declared sharply,
"to go making a joke of a subject like that to a
young lady you haven't known above a half an hour
hardly."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;267]</span>
"I wasn't thinking about the humourousness
of the proposition, Cousin Nellie!" protested Mr.
Hiram P. Jessop steadily. "I meant it perfectly
seriously."</p>

<p>Miss Million gazed at him from the chair opposite.</p>

<p>Her cousin met that challenging, distrustful gaze
unflinchingly. And in his own grey eyes I noticed a
mixture of obstinacy and of quite respectful admiration.
Certainly the little thing was looking very pretty
and spirited.</p>

<p>Every woman has her "day." It's too bad that this
generally happens at a time when nobody calls and
there's not a soul about to admire her at her best.
The next evening, when she's got to wear a low-cut frock
and go out somewhere, the chances are a hundred to
one that it will be her "day off," and that she will
appear a perfect fright, all "salt-cellars" and rebellious
wisps of hair.</p>

<p>But to proceed with Miss Million, who was walking
off with one man's admiration by means of the added
good looks she had acquired by being in love with another
man. Such is life.</p>

<p>"You mean it seriously?" she repeated.</p>

<p>"I do," he said, nodding emphatically. "I certainly
do."</p>

<p>Miss Million said: "You must be barmy!"</p>

<p>"Barmy?" echoed her American cousin. "You
mean&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Off your onion. Up the pole. Wrong in your 'ead&mdash;head,"
explained Miss Million. "That's what you
must be. Why, good gracious alive! The idea! Proposing
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;268]</span>
to marry a girl the first time you ever set eyes
on her. Smith, did you ever&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I never had to sit in the room before while another
girl was being proposed to," I put in uncomfortably.
"If you don't mind, Miss, I think I had
better go now, and allow you and Mr. Jessop to talk
this over between yourselves."</p>

<p>"Nothing of the kind, Miss Smith, nothing of the
kind," put in the suitor, turning to me as I stood ready
to flee to scenes less embarrassing. "You're a nice,
well-balanced, intell'gent sort of a young lady yourself.
I'd just like to have your point of view about this affair
of my cousin arranging to marry me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm not arranging no such thing," cried Miss Million,
"and don't mean to!"</p>

<p>"See here; you'd far better," said Mr. Hiram P.
Jessop, in his kindly, reasonable, shrewd, young voice.
"Look at the worry and discomfort and argument and
inconvenience about the money that she'd avoid"&mdash;again
turning to Miss Million's maid&mdash;"if she agreed to do
so."</p>

<p>"Then, again," he went on, "what a much more comfortable
situation for a young lady of her age and appearance
if she could go travelling around with a
husky-looking sort of husband, with a head on his shoulders,
rather than be trapesing about alone, with nothing
but a young lady of a lady's-maid no older or fitter to
cope with the battles of life than she is herself. A husband
to keep away the sordid and disagreeable aspects
of life&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here I remembered suddenly the visit of that detective
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;269]</span>
who wanted to search Miss Million's boxes at
the Cecil. I thought to myself: "Yes! if we only had
a husband. I mean if she had! It would be a handy
sort of thing to be able to call in next time we were
suspected of having taken anybody's rubies!"</p>

<p>And then I remembered with a shock that I hadn't
yet had time to break it to my mistress that we had
been suspected&mdash;were probably still suspected&mdash;by that
awful Rattenheimer person!</p>

<p>Meanwhile Miss Million's cousin and would-be husband
was going on expatiating on the many advantages,
to a young lady in her position, of having a real
man to look after her interests&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"All very true. But I don't know as I'm exactly
hard up for a husband," retorted Miss Million, with
a little simper and a blush that I knew was called up
by the memory of the blue, black-lashed eyes of a
certain Irish scamp and scaramouch who ought to
be put in the stocks at Charing Cross as an example
to all nice girls of the kind of young man whom it is
desirable to avoid and to snub. Miss Million added:
"I don't know that I couldn't get married any time
I wanted to."</p>

<p>"Sure thing," agreed her cousin gravely. "But the
question is, how are you going to know which man's
just hunting you for the sake of Uncle Sam's dollars?
Making love to the girl, with his eyes on the pork
factory?"</p>

<p>"Well, I must say I think that comes well from
you!" exclaimed Miss Million. "You to talk about
people wanting to marry me for my money, when you've
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;270]</span>
just said yourself that you've set your heart on those
dollars of Uncle Sam's for your old aeroplane machine!
You're a nice one!"</p>

<p>"I'm sincere," said the young American, in a voice
that no one could doubt. "I want the dollars. But
I wouldn't have suggested marrying them&mdash;if I hadn't
liked the little girl that went with them. I told you
right away when I came into this room, Cousin Nellie,
that I think you're a little peach. As I said, I like your
pretty little frank face and the cunning way you fix
yourself up. I like your honesty. No beating about
the bush."</p>

<p>He paused a second or so, and then went on.</p>

<p>"'You must be barmy,' says you. It appeared that
way to you, and you said it. That's my own point of
view. If you mean a thing, say it out. You do. I
like that. I revere that. And in a charming little
girl it's rare," said the American simply. "I like
your voice&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here I suppressed a gasp, just in time. He liked
Million's voice! He liked that appalling Cockney accent
that has sounded so much more ear-piercing and
nerve-rasping since it has been associated with the
clothes that&mdash;well, ought to have such a very much
prettier sort of tone coming out of them!</p>

<p>He liked it. Oh, he must be in love at first sight&mdash;at
first sound!</p>

<p>"Plenty of these young English girls talk as if it
sprained them over each syllable. You're brisk and
peart and alive," he told her earnestly. "I think
you've a lovely way of talking."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;271]</span>
Miss Million was taking it all in, as a girl does take
in compliments, whether they are from the right man
or from the wrong one. That is, she looked as if every
word were cream to her. Only another woman could
have seen which remark she tossed aside in her own
mind as "just what he said," and which tribute she
treasured.</p>

<p>I saw that what appealed to Miss Million was "the
lovely way of talking" and "the cunning way she'd
fixed herself up." In fact, the two compliments she
deserved least.</p>

<p>Oh, how I wished she'd say "Yes, thank you," at
once to a young man who would certainly be the solution
of all my doubts and difficulties as far as my
young mistress was concerned! He'd look after her.
He'd spoil her, as these Americans do spoil their adored
womenkind!</p>

<p>All her little ways would be so "noo," as he calls it,
to him, that he wouldn't realise which of them were&mdash;were&mdash;were
the kind of thing that would set the teeth
on edge of, say, the Honourable Jim Burke.</p>

<p>He&mdash;Mr. Hiram P. Jessop&mdash;would make an idol and
a possession of his little English wife. That conscienceless
Celt would make a banking-account of her&mdash;nothing
else.</p>

<p>Oh, yes! How I wished she'd take her cousin and
be thankful&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>But here was Miss Million shaking her little dusky
head against the gay-coloured cushions.</p>

<p>"I'm sure it's very kind of you to say all this," she
told him in a rather mollified tone of voice, "but I'm
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;272]</span>
afraid we can't arrange things the way you'd like. A
girl can't sort of make herself like people better than
other people, just because it might 'appen to be convenient."</p>

<p>"Other people," repeated the young American
quickly. "Am I to take it that there is some one else
that you prefer, Cousin Nellie?"</p>

<p>His cousin Nellie's very vivid blush seemed to be
enough answer for him.</p>

<p>He rose, saying slowly: "Why, that's a pity. That
makes me feel real out of it. Still&mdash;&mdash;" He shrugged
the broad shoulders under the light-grey padded coat.
"As you say, it can't be helped. I congratulate whoever
it is that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ow, stop! Gracious alive, there isn't any one to
be congratulated yet," broke in Miss Million. "Me
and&mdash;the gentleman haven't gone and definitely made
up our minds about anything, up to now; but&mdash;well.
As you say, it's better to have anything 'out.'"</p>

<p>"If you haven't definitely made up your mind," said
the young American, just as he took his leave, "I shan't
definitely take 'No' for my own answer."</p>

<p>And he's gone off now to put up at an hotel in
Lewes, so that he can come over to call at the "Refuge"
each day of the week that Miss Million says we
are going to stay here. He thinks, I know, that after
all he will "get round her" to like him.</p>

<p>As if, poor fellow! he had any chance at all against
a man like the Honourable Jim!</p>

<p>Well! He'll soon see, that's all!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>

<h3>THE CROWDED HOLIDAY</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">We</span> have now been staying for two crowded days at
the "Refuge." It has certainly been the most extraordinary
holiday of my life. A quite indescribable one,
too!</p>

<p>For when I try to put down in words my impression
of what has been happening, I find in my mind
nothing but the wildest jumble of things. There's a
background of sun-lit, open country, wide blue sky patrolled
by rolling white clouds, green downs strewn
with loose flint, chalk wastes on which a patch of scarlet
poppies stands out like a made-up mouth on a dead white
face of a pierrot, glimpses of pale cliff beyond the
downs, and of silver-grey Channel further still.</p>

<p>These things are blurred in a merry chaos with so
many new faces! There's the drowsy, good-natured,
voluptuous face of "Marmora, the breathing statue-girl,"
as she lounged in the deck-chair in the shadow of
the lilacs, crunching Mackintosh's toffee-de-luxe and
reading "The Rosary." The tiny, vivacious face of
the Boy-Impersonator. The shrewd face of Vi Vassity,
the mistress of the "Refuge," melting into unexpected
tenderness as she bends over the new baby that belongs
to the ventriloquist's wife, the little bundle with the
creasy pink face and the hands that are just clusters
of honeysuckle buds....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;274]</span>
So many sounds, too, are mixed up with this jumble
of fresh impressions!</p>

<p>Rustling of sea winds in the immemorial elm trees.
Buzzing of bees in the tall limes all hung with light-green
fragrant tassels! Twittering of birds! Comfortable,
crooning noises of plump poultry in the back yard
of the "Refuge."</p>

<p>Through all these sound the chatter and loud laughter
of the "resting" theatrical girls with their eternal
confidences that begin, "I said to him just like this,"
and their "Excuse me, dears," and their sudden bursts
of song. How the general rush, and whirl, and glitter,
and clatter of them would make my Aunt Anastasia
feel perfectly faint!</p>

<p>Eight or ten aspirins, I should think, would not be
enough to restore her, could she but have a glimpse of
the society into which Lady Anastasia's great-granddaughter
is now plunged.</p>

<p>And in such an "infra dig." position, too!</p>

<p>For I am not "an artist," as they all are! I am distinctly
quite below them! I am in domestic service. A
"dresser" of the girl whom all of them call "Nellie"
when they are not using the generic "dears" and
"darlings" to her. And yesterday I heard the Serio-singer
with the autumn-foliage hair telling the stout
lady (whose place in life seems to be swinging on a
trapeze in emerald-green tights and with a parrakeet
perched on each wrist) "That that little Smith was
quite a nice, refined sort of little thing, very different
from the usual run of girls of that class. They're so
common, as a rule. But this one&mdash;well! She's the sort
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;275]</span>
of girl you didn't mind sitting down with, or saying anything
in front of.</p>

<p>"Her and Nellie Million seemed to be more like two
sisters than mistress and maid, what I can see of it,"
said the washed-out-looking Serio, who "makes up,"
Million says, with dark brows and well-defined scarlet
lips until she must be quite effective, "on."</p>

<p>"There's something very queer about those two girls,
and the way they are together," added the Serio. (One
really can't help overhearing these theatrical voices,
and all the windows were wide open.) "There's that
gentleman cousin of Nellie's, who always calls the other
girl 'Miss' Smith. D'you notice, Emmie? He treats
her for all the world as if she were a duchess in disguise!
It might be her he was after, instead of the
other one?"</p>

<p>"With Americans," said the green-tights-and-parrakeets
lady impressively, "it's a fair puzzle to know
what they are 'after'!"</p>

<p>She, I know, has toured a good deal in the States.
So she ought to know what she is talking about. But
Mr. Hiram P. Jessop is the only American of whom I
can say that I have seen very much.</p>

<p>Each day he has driven over from Lewes, that
drowsy old town with one pricked-up ear of a castle
on a hill; and he spends hours and hours talking to
the little cousin whom I really think he sincerely likes.</p>

<p>"And, mind you! I am not saying that I don't
like him," Miss Million confided to me last night as I
was brushing her hair. "Maybe I might have managed
to get myself quite fond of him, if&mdash;if," she
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;276]</span>
sighed&mdash;"I hadn't happened to meet somebody else
first. I don't see any manner of use in getting engaged
to one young man when it is another that you
fancy. Simply asking for trouble, that is. Haven't
I read tales and tales about that sort of thing?"</p>

<p>I sighed as I tied a bit of pink ribbon round the
ends of Miss Million's dark plaits. If only she
hadn't happened ever to meet that incorrigible Jim
Burke!</p>

<p>"You haven't heard from him, Miss Million?" I
suggested. "You haven't seen anything of him since
he went off after lunch the day I came over with your
cousin?"</p>

<p>"I tell you what it is, Smith. You have got a down
on him! Always had, for some reason," said Miss Million
quite fretfully. She got up from the chair in
front of the looking-glass and stood, a defiant little
sturdy figure in the new crepe-de-chine nightie with the
big silken "M" that I had embroidered just over her
honest heart. "You are always trying to make out
that the Hon. Mr. Burke is not to be trusted, or somethink.
I am sure you are wrong."</p>

<p>"What makes you so sure of that?" I asked rather
ruefully.</p>

<p>"Well, it isn't likely I should take a fancy to any
one I didn't think I could trust," said Miss Million
firmly. "And as for his not having been here this
last day or two, well! I don't think anything of that.
A gentleman has got his business to attend to, whatever
it may be. Hasn't he?"</p>

<p>I said nothing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;277]</span>
"I am not fretting one bit just because he has not
been to see me," maintained Miss Million stoutly, in a
way that convinced me only too well how her whole heart
was set upon the next time she should see the Hon.
Jim. "It would not surprise me at all if he just turned
up for that picnic on the cliffs that we are all going
to to-morrow. I know Vi told him he could come to
that. I bet he will come. And in those tales," added
Miss Million, "it is very often at a picnic that the
hero chooses to go and ask the young lady to marry
him!" She concluded with an inflection of hope in
the voice that Mr. Hiram P. Jessop had said was so
pretty.</p>

<p>Poor Mr. Jessop! He may win Million's fortune for
his aeroplane invention. But good-bye to his chances
of the heiress herself if the Hon. Jim does turn up to-morrow.</p>

<p>The Hon. Jim Burke did turn up. But not at the
picnic, exactly.... Let me tell you about it from
the beginning. The picnic was to take place on the
cliffs near Rottingdean. Some of the "Refugettes"
walked, looking like a band of brightly dressed, buoyant-spirited
schoolgirls on a holiday. Two of the
party, namely, Mr. Jessop and his cousin, my mistress,
motored in the little two-seater car that he had kept on
to stay with him in Lewes. Others had hired donkeys,
"for the fun of the thing." Marmora, the Twentieth-Century
Hebe, and her friend, the Boy-Impersonator,
had been very sweet and friendly in their offers to me
to join the donkey-riding party. But for some reason
I felt I wanted to be quiet. I had one of those "aloof"
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;278]</span>
moods which I suppose everybody knows. One feels
not "out of tune" with one's surroundings, and disinclined
for conversation. The girls and Miss Vi Vassity
and my mistress and the one man at the picnic, namely,
Mr. Jessop, all seemed to me like gaily coloured pictures
out of some vivacious book. Something to look at!
After the noisy, laughing lunch, when the party had
broken up into chattering groups of twos and threes,
and were walking farther down the cliffs, I felt as if I
were glad that for a few minutes this gay and amusing
book could be closed. I didn't go with any of them.
I pleaded tiredness. I said I would stay behind and
have a little rest on the turf, in the shadow of Miss Vi
Vassity's bigger car that had brought over the luncheon
things.</p>

<p>The party melted away. I watched them disappear
in a sort of moving frieze between the thymy turf and
the hot, blue sky. Then I made a couch for myself of
one of the motor-rugs and a gay-coloured cushion or
two. I had taken off my black hat and I curled myself
up comfortably in a long reverie. My thoughts drifted
at last towards that subject which they accuse girls'
thoughts (quite unjustly!) of never leaving.</p>

<p>The subject of getting married! Was I or was I
not going to get married? Should I say "Yes" or
"No" to Mr. Brace when that steady and reliable and
desirable young Englishman returned from Paris, and
came to me for his answer? Probably "Yes." There
seemed no particular reason why it should not be
"Yes." I quite like him, I had always rather liked him.
As for him, he adored me in his honest way. I could
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;279]</span>
hear again the unmistakable earnestness in his voice
as he repeated the time-honoured sentiment, "You are
the one girl in the world for me!"</p>

<p>Why should I even laugh a little to myself because
he used a rather "obvious" expression?&mdash;an expression
that "everybody" uses. If you come to that, nobody
else has ever used it to me! And I don't believe
that he, Mr. Reginald Brace, has ever used it before.
It would not surprise me at all if he had never made
love, real, respectful, with-a-view-to-matrimony love, to
any other girl but me.</p>

<p>Very likely he's scarcely even flirted with anybody
else.</p>

<p>Something tells me that I should be the very first
woman in this man's life.</p>

<p>Now isn't that a beautiful idea?</p>

<p>No other woman in the world will have taught him
how to make love.</p>

<p>Any girl ought to be pleased with a husband like
that! She would not have to worry her head about
"where" he learnt to be so attractive, and sympathetic,
and tactful, and companionable, and to give all
the right sort of little presents and to say all the right
kind of pretty things. She would not have to feel that
he must have been "trained" through love affairs of
every kind, class and age. She would not have to catch,
in his speech, little "tags" of pointed, descriptive,
feminine expression; she wouldn't have to wonder:
What girl used he to hear saying that? Ah, no! The
wife of a man like Mr. Reginald Brace wouldn't be made
to feel like purring with pleasure over the deft way
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;280]</span>
he tied the belt of her sports coat and pinned in her
collar at the back or put her wrap about her shoulders
at the end of the second act&mdash;she wouldn't have
to remember: "Some woman must have taught him to be
so nice in these 'little ways' that make all the difference
to us women...."</p>

<p>There'd be none of all this about Mr. Brace. I
should be the first&mdash;the one&mdash;the only Love! Oughtn't
that thought to be enough to please and gratify any
girl?</p>

<p>And I am gratified....</p>

<p>I must be gratified.</p>

<p>If I haven't been feeling gratified all this time, it's
simply because I've been so "rushed" with the worry
of Miss Million's disappearance, and of all that business
about the detective, and the missing ruby. (I
wonder, by the way, if we have heard the last of all
that business?)</p>

<p>Anybody would like a young man like Mr. Brace!
Even Aunt Anastasia, when she came to know him.
Even she would rather I were a bank manager's wife
than that I went on being a lady's-maid for the rest of
my life....</p>

<p>"And, besides, I'm not like poor Million, who's allowed
her affections to get all tangled up in the direction
of the sort of young man who'd make the worst
husband in the world," I thought, idly, as I turned my
head more comfortably on the cushion. "Poor dear!
If she married Mr. Jessop, it would be better for her.
But still, she would be giving her hand to one man,
while her heart had been&mdash;well, 'wangled,' we'll say, by
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;281]</span>
another. How dreadful to have to be in love with a
man like that mercenary scapegrace of a Jim Burke!
How any girl could be so foolish as to give him one
serious thought&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here I gave up thinking at all. With my eyes shut
I just basked, to the tune of the bees booming in the
scented thyme about me and the waves washing rhythmically
at the foot of the tall white cliff on the top of
which our noisy party had been feasting.</p>

<p>It was nice to be alone here now, quite alone....
The washing of the waves seemed presently to die away
in my ears. The booming of the bees in those pink
cushions of thyme seemed to grow fainter and fainter....
Then these sounds began to increase again in a
sweet, and deep, and musical crescendo. Very pretty,
that chorus of the bees!</p>

<p>I kept my eyes shut and I listened.</p>

<p>The refrain seemed actually to grow into a little
rhythmic tune. Then&mdash;surely those were words that
were fitted to the tune? Yes! I caught the words of that
tender old Elizabethan cradle song:</p>

<p class="blockquotc">"Gol-den slum-bers kiss your eyes!"</p>

<p>For a second I imagined that the Serio-girl had stolen
up, and, thinking I was asleep, had begun to sing me
awake.</p>

<p>Then I realised that it was a man's voice that
crooned so close behind my ear.</p>

<p>Quickly I opened my eyes and turned.</p>

<p>I found myself looking straight into those absurdly
brilliant, dark-blue eyes, fringed by those ridiculously
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;282]</span>
long black lashes of Miss Million's adored, the Hon. Jim.
So he'd come!</p>

<p>Hastily I sat up, with my hands to my hair.</p>

<p>"It looks very nice as it is, Miss Lovelace," said
the Hon. Jim gravely, with a curious twitch at the
corners of his firmly cut mouth. "Tell me, now. Do
you consider it a fair dispensation of Providence that
all the domestic virtues should be of less avail to a girl
in a sea-breeze than the natural kink in the chestnut hair
of her?"</p>

<p>It is ridiculous, the way this young man always starts
a conversation with some silly question to which there
is absolutely no answer!</p>

<p>The only thing to be done was to ignore it! So I
rose to my feet as primly as I could, and said: "Good
afternoon! They will all be sorry that you came too
late for the picnic. I believe Miss Vi Vassity has gone
down there, to the left"&mdash;here I pointed towards the
grey-blue sweep of distance cut by the mast of a wireless
station somewhere near. "And Miss Million is
with her."</p>

<p>The Hon. Jim said gently: "I was not really asking
which way they had gone. What I really wanted to
know is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here he looked hard at me&mdash;&mdash;"What has happened
to&mdash;" here his voice changed again&mdash;"to the
gentleman from the new, young, and magnificent country,
where the girls are all peaches, and their lovers are
real, virile, red-blooded, clean-limbed, splendid specimens
of what the Almighty intended the young man to
be, I guess?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;283]</span>
Try as I would, I could not keep my lips from quivering
with laughter at the perfect imitation which Mr.
Burke gave of the young man who was certainly worth
ten of him in every way, even if he does not speak
with the accent of those who have "come down"
(and a good long way, too) from the Kings of
Ireland.</p>

<p>"If you mean Mr. Jessop," I said distantly, "I
think he went off with Miss Vassity and his cousin."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the Hon. Jim, on a long-drawn note.
"Oh! the cousin of the little Million, is he? Is that it?
Does that account for it?"</p>

<p>"Account for what?" I said rather snappishly; and
then, feeling rather afraid that he might answer with
something that had nothing to do with the matter in
hand, I went on hastily: "I don't think they can have
gone more than about ten minutes. They will be so
glad to see you! You will easily catch them up if you
hurry, Mr. Burke&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mr. Burke allowed all the noble reproach of a hunger-striking
suffragist to appear in those blue eyes of his
as he looked down at me.</p>

<p>"Child, have you the heart of a stone?" he asked
seriously. "'Hurry,' says she! Hurry! To a starving man
who has walked from the Refuge here on his
flat feet, without so much as a crumb of lunch or the
memory of a drink to fortify him! Hurry? Is that all
you can think of?"</p>

<p>Well, then, of course&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>One can't let a man starve, can one? So&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>I was simply forced to do what I could for this undeserving
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;284]</span>
late-comer in the way of feeding him after
his tramp across the downs.</p>

<p>I gave him a seat on the rug. I foraged in the re-packed
luncheon baskets, and got him a clean plate,
knives, forks, glass.... I brought out all that was
left by the "Refuge" party of the hunter's beef, the
cold chicken, the ham, the steak-and-kidney pie, and
the jam pasty that had been made by the Serio-girl, who
is in her "off" moments a particularly good
cook.</p>

<p>The Honourable Jim did appreciate the meal!</p>

<p>Also he seems to enjoy having a woman to wait hand
and foot upon him.</p>

<p>In fact he "made errands" for me among the devastated
luncheon baskets in the shadow of the car.</p>

<p>He demanded pepper (which had been forgotten).</p>

<p>He wanted more claret (when all had been finished).</p>

<p>Finally he demanded whole-meal bread instead of the
ordinary kind.</p>

<p>"There isn't any," I said.</p>

<p>"Why not?" he demanded, aggrieved.</p>

<p>I laughed at him across the big table-napkin that
I had spread as a cloth, pinning it down with four of
the irregular, sun-heated flints that lay loose on the
turf all about us. I said: "I suppose you're accustomed
to have everything 'there' that you happen to
want?"</p>

<p>"I am not," said the Honourable Jim. "But I'm
accustomed to getting it 'there' one way or another."</p>

<p>"I see. Is there anything else that I ought to do
for you that I've forgotten?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;285]</span>
"There is. You haven't called me 'Sir,'" said the
Honourable Jim. "I like you to call me 'Sir.'"</p>

<p>Immediately I made up my mind that the word
should never pass my lips to him again.</p>

<p>But he went on eating heartily, chattering away between
the mouthfuls.... I scarcely know what the
man said! But I suppose all kinds of worthless people
have that gift of making themselves "at home" in any
company they like, and of carrying on that flow of talk
that they contrive to make sound amusing, although it
looks perfectly silly written down....</p>

<p>One can't imagine anybody really sterling (like my
Mr. Brace, for example) exploiting a characteristic of
this sort. The Honourable Jim is "at" it the whole
time. Just to keep his hand in, of course!</p>

<p>(I never cease to see through him.)</p>

<p>At last he finished lunching. He pulled out a very
pretty platinum cigarette-case.</p>

<p>(I wondered who he had "wangled" that out of.)</p>

<p>"Miss Lovelace, you don't smoke?"</p>

<p>"No, thank you. I don't."</p>

<p>"Ah! That's another pleasing thing about you, is
it?"</p>

<p>This made me sorry I hadn't taken one of his horrid
fat cigarettes.</p>

<p>I said: "I suppose you would think it unwomanly
of me if I smoked?"</p>

<p>He laughed. "Child," he said, "you have the prettiest
obsolete vocabulary to be got anywhere outside
Fielding. 'Unwomanly,' is it, to smoke? I don't know;
I only know that nine out of ten women do it so badly
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;286]</span>
I want to take the cigarette out of their fingers and
pitch it into the grate for them! Clouds of smoke they
puff out straight into your face till you'd think 'twas
a fiery-breathing dragon in the room! And staining
their fingers to the knuckle as if they'd dipped them in
egg. And smothering themselves with the smell of it in
a way no man manages to do&mdash;why, by the scent you'd
scarcely tell if it was hair they'd got on their heads or
the stuffing out of the smoking-room cushions! I can't
ever understand how they get any man to want to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here he went off at a tangent.</p>

<p>"Don't let your young mistress learn the cigarette
habit, will you? By the way, you've contrived to improve
the little Million in several ways since last I
saw you."</p>

<p>Oh!</p>

<p>So possibly he really had been paying serious court
to the heiress. Yes; again I had the foreboding shudder.
Complications ahead; what with the Honourable
Jim and the Determined Jessop, and the Enamoured
Million&mdash;to say nothing of the bomb-dropping machine
and the fortune that may be lost!</p>

<p>"You look thoughtful, Miss Lovelace," said the fortune-hunter
who doesn't know there may be no fortune
in it. "Mayn't I congratulate you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?" I said, quickly looking up from the
luncheon basket that I was repacking. I wondered
where he might have heard anything about my Mr.
Brace. "Congratulate me?"</p>

<p>"Why, on your achievements as a lady's-maid."</p>

<p>"Oh! Oh, yes. Very kind of you to say I had effected
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;287]</span>
'improvements,'" I said as bitingly as I could.
"I suppose you mean Miss Million's hands that you
were so severe about?"</p>

<p>Here my glance fell upon Mr. Burke's own hands,
generally gloved.</p>

<p>They gave me a shock.</p>

<p>They were so surprisingly out of keeping with the
rest of his otherwise well-groomed and expensive appearance,
for the nails were rough and worn; the fingers
stumpy and battered and hard, the palms horny as those
of a navvy.</p>

<p>The Honourable Jim saw my look.</p>

<p>"Yes! You think my own hands are no such beauties.
Faith, you're right, child," he said, carelessly
flicking the ash from his cigarette off against a flint.
"I never could get my hands fit to be seen again after
that time I came across as a stoker."</p>

<p>"A stoker?" I repeated, staring at the young man.
"What on earth were you doing as a stoker?"</p>

<p>"Working my passage across home from Canada
one time," he told me. "You know I was sent out to
Canada by the old man with about five bob a week to
keep up the old family traditions and found a new family
fortune. Oh, quite so."</p>

<p>"What did you do?" I asked. One couldn't help
being a little interested in the gyrations of this rolling
stone that has acquired polish and nothing else.</p>

<p>"Do? Nothing. A bit of everything. Labourer,
farm hand. On a ranch, finally," he said, "where they
wouldn't give me anything to eat until I'd 'made good.'
Yes, they were harder than you are, little black pigeon-girl
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;288]</span>
that I thought had the heart of a stone under the
soft black plumage of her. And by 'making good' they
meant taking a horse&mdash;a chestnut, same coloured coat
as your hair, child&mdash;that nobody else could ride. I
had to stick on her for three hours, and I stuck on. I
told myself I'd rather die than come off. And I didn't
come off, nor yet did I die, as you may perceive,"
laughed the Honourable Jim, tossing the end of the
cigarette over the cliff, above which the gulls were wheeling
and calling in voices as shrill as those of the
"Refuge" girls. "But they had to carry us both
home&mdash;the horse and myself."</p>

<p>"Why carry you?"</p>

<p>"The pair of us were done," he said. "But it
was a grand afternoon we had, Miss Lovelace, I
can tell you. I wish you'd been there, child, looking
on."</p>

<p>It was very odd that he should say this.</p>

<p>For at that very instant I had found myself wishing
that I could have seen him mastering the vicious
chestnut.</p>

<p>I should have loved to have watched that elemental
struggle between man and brute with the setting of
the prairie and the wide sky. However much of "a
bad hat" and a "waster" he is, he has at least lived a
man's life, doing the things a man should do before
he drifted to that attic in Jermyn Street and those more
expensive town haunts where anybody else pays. Impulsively
I looked up at the big, expensively dressed
young loiterer with the hands that bear those ineradicable
marks of strenuous toil. And, impulsively, I said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;289]</span>
"Why didn't you stay where you were? Oh, what a
pity you ever came back!"</p>

<p>There was a pause before he laughed. And then we
had what was very like a squabble! He said, in a not-very-pleased
voice: "You'd scorn to say flattering
things, perhaps?"</p>

<p>"Well," I said, "I'm not a Celt&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You mean that," he said sharply, "to stand for
everything that's rather contemptible. I know! You
think I'm utterly mercenary&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well! You practically told me that you were
that!"</p>

<p>"And you believe some of the things I tell you, and
not others. You pick out as gospel the ones that are
least to my credit," the Honourable Jim accused me.
"How like your sex!"</p>

<p>How is it that these four words never fail to annoy
our sex?</p>

<p>I said coldly: "I don't see any sense or use in our
standing here quarrelling like this, all about nothing,
on such a lovely afternoon, and all. Hadn't you better
find your hostess?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps I had," said Mr. Burke, without moving.</p>

<p>I was determined he should move!</p>

<p>I said: "I will come a little of the way with you."</p>

<p>"And what about the rugs and things here?"</p>

<p>"I shan't lose sight of them."</p>

<p>"Oh."</p>

<p>In silence we moved off over the turf. And, ridiculous
as it was, each of us kept up that resentful silence
until, far off on the green downs, we saw moving towards
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;290]</span>
us three specks of colour: a light grey speck between a
pink and a blue speck.</p>

<p>"There they are," I told him. "Miss Vassity and
my mistress and her cousin."</p>

<p>"Give me your moral support, then; don't run away
till I've said good afternoon to them," Mr. Burke said,
as if in an agony of shyness. And then the blue imps
came back to sweep the resentment out of his eyes. He
looked down at me and said: "Child! Think me all
that's bad, if you want to. Enlarge upon the affecting
'pity' of it that I didn't stay out day-labouring
in Canada, instead of wangling my keep out of
fools at home, to whom I'm well worth all the cash I
cost 'em! Go on despising me. But listen. Give me
credit for one really high-principled action, Miss
Lovelace!"</p>

<p>"What is it?" I demanded rather scornfully.
"When have you shown me any kind of high principledness?"</p>

<p>"This afternoon," he retorted. "Just now. Just
when I came upon the Sleeping Beauty on the cliffs!"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean that it's not every man who would have
woke her up with just a snatch of song. And I that
am so&mdash;so hard up for a pair of decent new gloves!"
he concluded, laughing.</p>

<p>And then he caught my eyes with his own, his insolent,
devil-may-care blue ones. He looked down, straight
down into them for a long moment.</p>

<p>I felt myself crimsoning under his regard. I felt&mdash;yes,
I don't know how it happened, but I did feel exactly
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;291]</span>
as if he had done what he had, after all, had the decency
to leave undone.</p>

<p>There's very little difference, apparently, between a
look like that&mdash;and a tangible caress....</p>

<p>And yet I couldn't say a word!</p>

<p>I couldn't accuse him&mdash;of anything!</p>

<p>Maddening young scamp!</p>

<p>I stood as straight as the wireless mast on the downs.
I glared out towards the steely glitter of the English
Channel.</p>

<p>"Ah, now, why should you be angry?" protested
that ineffably gentle Irish voice beside me. "Sure I'm
only just pointing out how differently an unscrupulous
fellow might have behaved. I never kissed you, child."</p>

<p>I couldn't think of a crushing retort. All I could
find to say was, of course, the very last thing I really
meant.</p>

<p>"I shall never forgive you!"</p>

<p>"What?" took up the Honourable Jim swiftly and
merrily. "Never forgive me for what?" To this I
didn't have to reply, for the other three people had
come quickly up to us.</p>

<p>Miss Million came up first, holding out both hands
to the Honourable Jim.</p>

<p>"At last! Well, you are a stranger, and no mistake!"
she declared, panting a little with the haste she
had made. "I have been looking out for you all the
morning&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Surely this is an attitude that Mr. Burke ought to
approve of in "our sex"!</p>

<p>"And I did hope," said Miss Million quite touchingly,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;292]</span>
"I did hope you was going to come over to see
me!"</p>

<p>I'm not quite sure whether I'm glad or sorry that
I happened to be present at that meeting on the sun-lit,
wind-swept downs between my mistress and the young
Irishman, to whom she presently introduced her cousin,
Mr. Hiram P. Jessop.</p>

<p>Really it was a most embarrassing moment. I think
nine out of ten women would have found it so! For
none of us really enjoy seeing a man "caught out" before
our eyes. And this was practically what happened
to the Honourable James Burke.</p>

<p>It served him right! It certainly was no more than
he deserved! And yet&mdash;and yet I couldn't help feeling,
as I say, sorry for him!</p>

<p>It happened thus.</p>

<p>Miss Million, flushed and sparkling with the delight
of seeing her hero, Mr. Jim Burke, again after three
days of separation, put on a pretty little air of hostess-ship
and began: "Oh, here's some one I want you to
know, Mr. Burke. A relative of mine. My cousin, Mr.
Jessop&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I have already had the pleasure of making Mr.
Burke's acquaintance," said the young American, with
that bow of his, to which Miss Million, standing there
between the two young men, exclaimed: "There now!
To think of that! I thought you hadn't had a word
together, that day at lunch&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It was before then, I think," began the Honourable
Jim, with his most charming smile. Whereupon
Miss Million interrupted once more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;293]</span>
"Oh, I see! Yes, of course. That must have been
in America, mustn't it? How small the world is, as
my poor Dad used to say. I s'pose you two met while
you was both attending to poor uncle, did you?"</p>

<p>Miss Million's cousin gave one of those quick, shrewd
glances of his at the other young man.</p>

<p>"Why, no, Cousin Nellie," he said slowly. "I hadn't
the pleasure of seeing Mr. Burke in the States. And
I wasn't aware that he was acquainted with our
uncle."</p>

<p>This was where Miss Million rushed in where any
other woman might have guessed it was better not to
tread.</p>

<p>"Oh, Lor', yes!" she exclaimed gleefully. "Mr.
Burke was a great friend of our Uncle Sam's. He told
me so the first time we met; in fac', that's how I come
to know him, wasn't it, Mr. Burke?"</p>

<p>She ran on, without waiting for any answer:
"Uncle used to call him 'Jim,' and to say he looked
forward to his coming every day that time when he had
to lay up for two months with that sprained ankle of
his&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"When was that, Cousin Nellie, if I may ask?" put
in the young American quietly.</p>

<p>"Why, that was just a twelvemonth ago, Mr. Burke
told me; didn't you, Mr. Burke?" ran on the unsuspecting
Miss Million, while I, standing still in the background
as a well-trained lady's-maid should do, permitted
myself one glance at the face of that young
pretender.</p>

<p>It was blank as a stone mask. I looked at Mr. Jessop.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;294]</span>
His grave, penetrating eyes were fixed upon that
mask.</p>

<p>As for Miss Vi Vassity, to whom I also turned, I
saw her common, clever, vivacious face lighted up with
a variety of expressions: amusement, curiosity, irony.
She knew, as well as I did, what was happening. She
was keener than I to see what would happen next.</p>

<p>In far less time than it takes to tell all this Miss
Million had rattled on: "Oh, yes; Mr. Burke was with
uncle in Chicago pretty near every day all the last
year of his life, wasn't you, Mr. Burke? Shows how
well he used to know him, doesn't it? And then when
he heard my name at the Hotel Sizzle!</p>

<p>"Soon as he heard that I was related to Mr. Samuel
Million, his old friend, he came round and chummed
up at once. It is funny, isn't it," concluded Miss Million,
"the queer way you get to know people that you've
never dreamt about?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it's real funny, I guess, that I haven't happened
to have gotten to know Mr. Burke while he was
on the other side," broke in the voice of the American,
speaking quietly but very distinctly as it "gave away"
the pretensions of the Honourable Jim in two simple
sentences.</p>

<p>"I guess there wasn't a day in the last two years
that I wasn't visiting the old man. And I never heard
anything about a sprained ankle, nor yet about his having
had any Mr. Burke to come around and see him."</p>

<p>After this revelation there was a pause that seemed
to last for ever. But I suppose it couldn't have been
as long as that. For I, turning my eyes from the quartette
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;295]</span>
on the turf, was watching a big white seagull
wheeling and swooping above the cliff.</p>

<p>Its long wings had only flapped, slowly, twice, before
the hearty voice of Miss Vi Vassity broke the silence
that I felt to be quite nerve-racking.</p>

<p>"Well! Are these biographical notes going to keep
us busy for the whole afternoon, or are we going to get
on to the spirit-kettle and the cakes?</p>

<p>"I'm fair dying for a drop to drink, I can tell you.
Talkin' does it. And I never can bear those flasks.
Don't trust 'em. Some careless hussy forgets to give
'em a proper clean-out once in a way, and the next
time you take your cup o' tea out of the thing where
are you? Poisoned and a week in a nursing-home. Miss
Vi Vassity, 'London's Love,' has been sufferin' from a
severe attack of insideitis, with cruel remarks from
<i>Snappy Bits</i> on the subject. Give me hot water out
of the kettle.</p>

<p>"Come on, Jim, you shall get it going; you're a
handy man with your feet&mdash;fingers, I mean; come on,
Miss Smith. The other girls seem to have lost themselves
somewhere; always do when there's a bit of housework
and women's sphere going on, I notice. We'll
spread the festive board. Nellie'll bring on the cousin&mdash;I
can see they've got secrets to talk. S'long!"</p>

<p>She kept up this babble during the whole of tea in
the lee of that motor on the downs where Mr. Burke
had come upon me as I drowsed after lunch.</p>

<p>The tea was even noisier and gayer than the lunch
had been. We had this flow of comment-on-nothing
from London's Love, and a couple of songs from our
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;296]</span>
Serio, and American tour reminiscences from our Lady
Acrobat. Also a loud and giggling squabble between
that lady and the Boy-Impersonator about which of
them looked her real age.</p>

<p>Also an exhibition of the blandishments of our
Twentieth-Century Hebe, who sat on the turf next to
the Honourable Jim. She was doing her utmost to
flirt with him; putting her lazy blonde head on one side
to cast languishing glances at him, invoking his pity
for a midge-bite that she said she had discovered on
her upper arm.</p>

<p>"Look," she murmured, holding out the sculptured
limb. "Does it show?"</p>

<p>That softly curved, white-skinned, blue-veined and
bare arm could have been his to hold for a nearer inspection
of that imperceptible wound if he had chosen.
I made sure he'd catch hold of it ... it would have
been just like him to laugh and suggest kissing it to
make it well. I'm sure that's what the "Breathing
Statue Girl" meant him to do. They're just a pair
of silly flirtatious Bohemians&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Rather to my surprise the Irishman merely gave a
matter-of-fact little nod and returned in a practical tone
of voice: "Yes; you've certainly got glorious arms of
your own, Miss Marmora; pity to let 'em get sunburnt
and midge-bitten. It'll show on the stage if you aren't
careful. I'd keep my sleeves down if I were you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"'And that's <i>that</i>!'" the Boy-Impersonator wound
up with George Robey's tag. And in the midst of all
the laughter and chatter no one seemed to notice that
two of the party were absolutely silent and almost too
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;297]</span>
absent-minded to drink their tea&mdash;namely, the American
cousin and Miss Nellie Million, the heiress.</p>

<p>I hardly dared to look at her. I thought I was in
for a terrible flood of tears and misery as soon as we
got home to the "Refuge."</p>

<p>For evidently Mr. Hiram P. Jessop had been getting
in quite a long talk with his cousin before tea, and I
am sure he had explained to her just the sort of
gay deceiver that her admired and Honourable Jim
was!</p>

<p>Oh, the disillusionment of that!</p>

<p>To find out that he had made that dead set at knowing
her from the beginning only because of her uncle's
money! And that, so far from there having been any
of that family friendship of which she was so proud,
he had never set eyes on old Mr. Million!</p>

<p>I was afraid she would be utterly heart-broken,
shaken with sobs over the perfidy of that handsome
impostor whom she must always love....</p>

<p>How little I knew her kind!</p>

<p>I was undeceived on the way home to the "Refuge."
Miss Million clutched me by the arm, holding me back
until every other member of the party, those who
walked, those who rode on donkeys, and those who
motored, had got well ahead.</p>

<p>"I'm walking back alone with you, Smith," she announced
firmly. "Let all of them get on, Hiram and
Vi and all. I want to speak to you. I'm fair bursting
to have a talk about all this."</p>

<p>I pressed the sturdy short arm in my own with as
much sympathy as I could show.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;298]</span>
"My dear! My dear Miss Million," I murmured,
"I am so dreadfully sorry about it all&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sorry? How d'you mean sorry, Smith?" My
unexpected little mistress turned sharply upon me.
"Y'orter to be glad, I should think!"</p>

<p>"Glad?"</p>

<p>"Yes! About me being 'put wise,' as Hiram calls
it, to something that I might have been going on and
on getting taken in about," went on Miss Million as we
started off to find the road over the downs.</p>

<p>"If it hadn't ha' bin for my cousin and him meeting
face to face, and him not able to deny what he'd
said, I might ha' been to the end of the chapter believing
every word I was told by that Mr. Burke. Did you
ever know anything like him and the lies he's been
stuffing me up with?"</p>

<p>I stared at the real and righteous and dry-eyed anger
that was incarnate in Million's little face as we walked
along.</p>

<p>I positively gasped over the&mdash;well, there's nothing
for it but to call it the distaste and dislike of the one
in which she pronounced those three words: "That Mr.
Burke."</p>

<p>"Whatcher looking so surprised at?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"You," I said. "Why&mdash;only yesterday you told
me that you were so much&mdash;that you liked Mr. Burke
so much!"</p>

<p>"Yesterday. O' course," said Million. "Yesterday
I hadn't been put wise to the sort of games he was
up to!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;299]</span>
"But&mdash;&mdash;You liked him enough to say you&mdash;you
were ready to marry him!"</p>

<p>"Yes! And there'd have been a nice thing," retorted
the indignant Million. "Fancy if I had a married
him. A man like that, who stuffed me up with all those
fairy tales! A nice sort of husband for anybody! I
can't be grateful enough to Hiram for telling me."</p>

<p>I was too puzzled to say anything. I could only give
little gasps at intervals.</p>

<p>"Isn't it a mercy," said Miss Million with real fervour,
"that I found him out in time? Why ever d'you
look at me like that? It is a mercy, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Yes, of course. Only I'm so surprised at
your thinking so," I hesitated. "You see, as you really
liked Mr. Burke&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, but I couldn't go on likin' him after I found
him out. How could I?" demanded Million briskly.
"Would any girl?"</p>

<p>I said: "I should have thought so. I can imagine a
girl who, if she really cared for a man, would go on
caring&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"After she found out the sort he was?"</p>

<p>"Yes. She might be very unhappy to find out. But
it wouldn't make any other difference&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?" cried Million, looking almost scandalised.
"I don't believe you can mean what you say!"</p>

<p>"I do mean what I say," I persisted, as we walked
along. "I think that if one really cared for a man,
the 'caring' would go on, whatever one found him out
in. He might be a murderer. Or a forger. Or he
might be in the habit of making love to every pretty
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;300]</span>
woman he saw. Or&mdash;or anything bad that one can
think of. And one might want to give up being fond
of him. But one wouldn't be able to. I shouldn't."</p>

<p>"Ah, well, there's just the difference between you
and I," said Miss Million, in such a brisk, practical,
matter-of-fact voice that one could hardly realise that
it belonged to the girl whose eyes had grown so dreamy
as she had spoken, only yesterday, of the Honourable
Jim.</p>

<p>"Now, I'm like this. If I like a person, I like 'em.
I'd stick to anybody through thick and thin. Do anything
for 'em; work my fingers to the bone! But there's
one thing they've got to do," said Miss Million impressively.
"They've got to be straight with me. I've
got to feel I can trust 'em, Smith. Once they've deceived
me&mdash;it's all over. See?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I see," I said, feeling more puzzled than ever
over the difference between one person's outlook and
another's. As far as I was concerned, I felt that "trusting"
and "liking" could be miles apart from each
other.</p>

<p>I shouldn't change my whole opinion of a man because
he had deceived me about knowing my uncle, and
because he had spun me a lot of "yarns" about that
friendship. Men were deceivers ever.</p>

<p>I, in Miss Million's place, should have shrugged my
shoulders over the unmasking of this particular deceiver,
and I should have said: "What can one expect
of a man with that voice and those eyes?"</p>

<p>Evidently in this thing Million, whom I've tried to
train in so many of the little ways that they consider
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;301]</span>
"the mark of a lady," is more naturally fastidious than
I am myself.</p>

<p>She said: "I don't mind telling you I thought a lot
o' that Mr. Burke. I thought the world of him. But
that's&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She gave a sort of little scattering gesture with her
hands.</p>

<p>"Why, I can't begin to tell you the yards of stuff
he's been telling me about uncle and the friends they
was! And now here it's all a make-up from the beginning.
He hadn't a word to say for himself. 'Jer
notice that, Smith?" said Miss Million.</p>

<p>"I expect he was ashamed to look any one in the
face, after the way he'd bin going on. Pretty silly I
expect he felt, having us know at last that it was all a
put-up job." I had to bite my lips to keep back a
smile.</p>

<p>For as Miss Million and I swung along the road that,
widening, led away from the downs and between hedges
and sloping fields, I remembered something. I remembered
that tea at Charbonnels with the Honourable
Jim.</p>

<p>It was there that he admitted to me, quite shamelessly,
that he had never, in the whole of his chequered
career, set eyes upon the late Samuel Million. It was
then that he calmly remarked to me: "You'll never tell
tales." So that it's quite a time that I've known the
whole discreditable story....</p>

<p>Yes; I confess that in some ways Miss Million must
have been born much more scrupulous and fastidious
than Lady Anastasia's great-granddaughter!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;302]</span>
"No self-respecting girl would want to look at him
again, I shouldn't think," concluded my young mistress
firmly, as we passed the first thatched cottages of
a village.</p>

<p>I ought to feel inexpressibly relieved. For now all
my fears regarding the Honourable Jim are at rest for
evermore. He won't marry her for her fortune, for the
simple reason that she won't have him! And she won't
break her heart and make herself wretched over this
perfidy of his, because a perfidious man ceases to have
any attraction for her honest heart. That sort of
girl doesn't, "while she hates the sin, love the poor
sinner."</p>

<p>What a merciful dispensation!</p>

<p>It's too utterly ridiculous to feel annoyed with Million
for turning her coat like this. It's inconsistent.
I mustn't be inconsistent. I must trample down this
feeling of being a little sorry for the blue-eyed pirate
who has been forced to strike his flag and to flee before
the gale of Miss Nellie Million's wrath.</p>

<p>I ought, if anything, to be still feeling angry with
Mr. James Burke on my own account: teasing me about
... pairs of gloves and all that nonsense!</p>

<p>Anyhow, there's one danger removed from the path.
And now I think I see clearly enough what must come.
Miss Million, having found that she's been deceived in
smooth talk and charming flattery and Celtic love-making,
will turn to the sincerity of that bomb-dropping
American cousin of hers.</p>

<p>They'll marry&mdash;oh, yes; they'll marry without another
hitch in the course of the affair. And I&mdash;&mdash;Yes,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;303]</span>
of course, I shall marry, too. I shall marry that
other honest and sincere young man&mdash;the English one&mdash;Mr.
Reginald Brace.</p>

<p>But I must see Million&mdash;Miss Million&mdash;married first.
I must dress her for her wedding. I must arrange the
veil over her glossy little dark head; I must order her
bouquet of white heather and lilies; I must be her
bridesmaid, or one of them, even if she does have a
dozen other girls from the "Refuge" as well!</p>

<p>And who'll give her away? Mr. Chesterton, the old
lawyer, will, I suppose, take the part of the bride's
father.</p>

<p>Miss Vi Vassity is sure to make some joke about being
the bride's mother. She is sure to be the life and soul
of that wedding-party&mdash;wherever it is. It's sure to be
a delightfully gay affair, the wedding of Nellie Million
to her cousin, Hiram P. Jessop! I'm looking forward
to it most awfully&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>These were the thoughts with which I was harmlessly
and unsuspectingly amusing myself as Miss Million and
I walked along down the white Sussex highroad in the
golden evening light.</p>

<p>And in the middle of this maiden meditation, in the
middle of the peaceful evening and the drowsy landscape
of rose-wreathed cottages and distant downs,
there dropped, as if from one of Mr. Jessop's machines,
a positive bomb!</p>

<p>The unexpected happened once more. The unexpected
took the form, this time, of an unobtrusive-looking
man on a bicycle.</p>

<p>When we met him, slipping along on the road coming
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;304]</span>
from the direction of Miss Vi Vassity's "Refuge," I
really hardly noticed that we had passed a cyclist.</p>

<p>Miss Million, apparently, had noticed; she straightened
her back with a funny little jerky gesture that
she has when she means to be very dignified. She turned
to me and said: "Well! He'll know us next time he
sees us, that's one thing! He didn't half give us a
look!"</p>

<p>"Did he?" I said absently.</p>

<p>Then we turned up the road to the "Refuge."
Neither of us realised that the man on the bicycle had
turned his machine, and had noiselessly followed us
down the road again.</p>

<p>We reached the white gate of the "Refuge," under
its dark green cliffs of elm. I had my hand on the latch
when I heard the quiet voice of the cyclist almost in my
ear.</p>

<p>"Miss Smith&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>I turned with a little jump. I gave a quick look
up at the man's face. It was the sort of quiet, neutral-tinted,
clean-shaven, self-contained ordinary face that
one would not easily remember, as a rule.</p>

<p>Yet I remembered it. I'd seen quite enough of it already.
It was burnt in on my memory with too unpleasant
an association for me to have forgotten it.</p>

<p>I heard myself give a little gasp of dismay as,
through the gathering dusk, I recognised the face of
the man who had wanted to search my trunks at the
Hotel Cecil; the man who had afterwards shadowed me
down the Strand and into the Embankment Garden;
the man from Scotland Yard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;305]</span>
Mercy! What could he want?</p>

<p>"Miss Million&mdash;&mdash;" he said.</p>

<p>And Miss Million, too, stared at him, and said:
"Whatever on earth is the meaning of this?"</p>

<p>There was a horrified little quaver in her voice as
she said it, for she'd guessed what was afoot.</p>

<p>I had already told her of the manager's visit to her
rooms the day before I came down from London, and
she had been really appalled at the event until Miss
Vi Vassity had come in to cheer her with the announcement
that she was sure this was the last that would
ever be heard by us of anything to do with having our
belongings looked at.</p>

<p>And now, after three or four days only, this!...</p>

<p>Here we stood on the dusty road under the elms,
with the man's bicycle leaning up against the white
palings. We were a curious trio! The young mistress
in a pink linen frock, the young lady's-maid in black,
and the "plain-clothes man" giving a quick glance
from one to the other as he announced in his clear but
quiet and expressionless voice: "I have to arrest you
ladies&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Arrest!" gasped Miss Million, turning white. I
grasped her hand.</p>

<p>"Don't be silly, my dear," I said as reassuringly as
I could, though my voice sounded very odd in my own
ears. Million looked the picture of guilt found out,
and I felt that there was a fatal quiver in my own tone.
I said: "It's quite all right!"</p>

<p>"I have to arrest you ladies," repeated the man
with the bicycle, in his wooden tone, "on the charge
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;306]</span>
of stealing Mr. Julius Rattenheimer's ruby pendant
from the Hotel Cecil&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I never! I never done it!" from Million, in
anguished protest. "You can ask anybody at the Orphanage
what sort of a&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I have to warn you that anything you say now
will be used in evidence against you," concluded the
man from Scotland Yard, "and my orders are to take
you back with me to London at once."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>

<h3>LOCKED UP!</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Who</span> could ever have anticipated this?</p>

<p>Who would have dreamt, a night or two ago, of where
Miss Million, the American Sausage-King's heiress, and
her aristocratically connected lady's-maid would have
had to spend last night?</p>

<p>I can hardly believe it myself, even yet.</p>

<p>I sit on this perfectly ghastly little bed, narrow and
hard as any stone tomb in a church. I gaze round at
the stone walls, and at the tiny square window high up;
at the tin basin, chained as if they were afraid it
might take flight somehow; at the door with the sliding
panel; the ominous-looking door that is locked upon
me!</p>

<p>And I say to myself, "Vine Street police-station!"</p>

<p>That's where I am. I, Beatrice Lovelace, poor
father's only daughter, and Lady Anastasia's great-granddaughter!
I've been taken up, arrested!</p>

<p>I'm a prisoner. I've slept&mdash;that is, I've not been
able to sleep&mdash;in a cell! I've been put in prison like
a pickpocket, or a man who's been drunk and disorderly,
or a window-smashing suffragette!</p>

<p>Only, of course, the suffragette does her best to
get into prison. She doesn't mind. It's a glory to
her. She comes out and "swanks" about in a peculiarly
hideous brooch that's been specially designed to
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;308]</span>
show that she's been sentenced to "one month," or
whatever it was.</p>

<p>She's proud of it. Oh, how can she be? Proud of
having spent so much time in a revolting place like this!
"I think," gazing round hopelessly once more&mdash;"oh,
I don't believe I shall ever be able to get the disgusting,
bleak, sordid look of it out of my mind, or the equally
sordid, bleak, disgusting smell of it out of my skirts
and my hair!"</p>

<p>And I clasp my hands in my lap and close my eyes
to shut out the look of those awful walls and that fearful
door.</p>

<p>I go over again the scene yesterday down at the
"Refuge," when we were arrested by that Scotland Yard
man, and when I had just enough presence of mind to
ask him to allow us, before we went off with him, to
leave word with our friends.</p>

<p>A group of our friends were already gathered on the
gravel path outside the house under the lilacs. And
there came running out at my call Miss Vi Vassity, half
a dozen of her Refugette girls, Miss Million's American
cousin, and&mdash;though I thought he must have taken his
departure!&mdash;the disgraced Mr. Burke.</p>

<p>In the kind of nightmare of explanations that ensued
I remember most clearly the high-pitched laugh of
"London's Love" as she exclaimed, "Charging them,
are you, officer? I suppose that means I've got to come
round and bail them out in the morning, eh? Not the
first time that Vi has had that to do for a pal of hers?
But, mind you, it's about the first time that there's been
all this smoke without any fire. Pinching rubies? Go
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;309]</span>
on. Go on home! Who says it? Rubies! Who's got
it?" she rattled on, while everybody stared at us.</p>

<p>The group looked like a big poster for some melodrama
on at the Lyceum, with three central figures
and every other person in the play gaping in the background.</p>

<p>"Oh, of course it's Miss Smith that collared Rats's
old ruby," went on Miss Vi Vassity encouragingly.
"Sort of thing she would do. Brought it down here
to the other little gal, my friend, Miss Nellie Million, I
presume? And what am I cast for in this grand finale?
Receiver of stolen goods, eh? Bring out some more
glasses, Emmie, will you?"&mdash;this to the Acrobat
Lady.</p>

<p>"What's yours, Sherlock Holmes?" to the detective.
Then to Miss Million, who was deathly pale and trembling:
"A little drop of something short will do you
no harm, my girl. You shall have the car to 'go
quietly' in, in a minute or two&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here the American accent of Mr. Hiram P. Jessop
broke in emphatically.</p>

<p>"There'll be no 'going' at all, Miss Vassity. I don't
intend to have any nonsense of this kind regarding a
young lady who's my relative, and another young lady
who is a friend of hers&mdash;and mine. See here, officer.
The very idea of charging 'em&mdash;why, it's all poppycock!
Miss Million is my cousin.</p>

<p>"Steal rubies&mdash;why on earth should she steal rubies?
Couldn't she buy up all the rubies in little old London
if she fancied 'em? Hasn't she the means to wear a
ruby as big as that of Mr. Rattenheimer's on every
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;310]</span>
finger of her little hands if she chose? See here, officer&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here the young American caught the Scotland Yard
man by the upper arm, and sought to draw him gently
but firmly out of that Lyceum poster group.</p>

<p>"See here. As you must have noticed at the Cecil,
Mr. Julius Rattenheimer's a friend of mine. I know
him. I know him pretty well, I guess. I'll go to him
right now, and explain to him that it's absolutely preposterous,
the mere idea of sending down to arrest a
pair of delicately nurtured, sensitive, perfectly lovely
young girls who'd as soon think of thieving jewels as
they would of&mdash;well, I can't say what. Here's where
words fail me. But I guess I'll have fixed up how to
put it when I get to Rats himself. I'll come along right
now to him with you. I've got my car here. I'll fix
it up.</p>

<p>"Don't you worry&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here I seemed to detect a movement of Mr. Hiram
P. Jessop's hand towards his breast-pocket.</p>

<p>Was it? Yes! He drew out a pigskin leather pocketbook.
Swiftly, but quietly, he took out notes....
"Heavens!" This sincere and well-meaning citizen of
no mean country was making an unapologised-for attempt
to bribe Scotland Yard!</p>

<p>Their backs were towards me now; I do wish I had
seen the detective's face! "See here, officer&mdash;&mdash;Ah,
you're proud? Well, that's all right. I've got my car
here, I say. You and I'll buzz up to Mr. Rattenheimer's,
I guess. We'll leave these young ladies here
with Miss Vassity&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;311]</span>
"Very sorry, sir, but that's quite impossible," declared
the even, expressionless voice of the Scotland
Yard man. "These ladies have to return to London
at once with me."</p>

<p>"But I tell you it's prepos&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Those are my orders, sir. Very sorry. If the car
is ready"&mdash;turning to Miss Vi Vassity&mdash;"I'll drive
her, I'll take these ladies now."</p>

<p>"All alone, with you? Faith, and that you won't,"
declared the Honourable Jim Burke, stepping forward
from where he had been standing, hastily finishing the
drink that had been poured out for him by the handsome
white hands of Marmora, the Breathing Statue.
"I'll go up with you, and see where you're taking the
ladies&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And I'll accompany you, if you'll permit me," from
Mr. Hiram P. Jessop.</p>

<p>"Room in the car for six. Pity I can't leave Maudie,
or I'd come. But young Olive must get her night's
rest to-night, so I'm doing nurse and attending to the
midget ventriloquist myself," declared the cheerful
voice of England's Premier Comedienne.</p>

<p>"See you to-morrow in court, girls. Don't look like
that, Nellie! You've got a face on you like a blessed
bridegroom; there's nothing to get scared about. Lor'!
No need to fret like that if you'd just been given ten
years!... Got plenty o' rugs, Miss Smith? I'd lend
one of you my best air-cushion to sleep on, full of the
sighs of me first love. But if I did they'd only pinch
it at the station. I know their tricks at that hole. So
long, Ah-Sayn Lupang!" Again to the detective:
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;312]</span>
"You ought to be at the top of your profession, you
ought; got such an eye for character. Cheery-Ho!"</p>

<p>And we were off; the detective, the two arrested
criminals (ourselves), the cousin of one of the "criminals"
and the Honourable Jim Burke. In what character
this young man was supposed to be travelling
with us I'm sure I don't know.</p>

<p>I only know that but for him that motor drive
through Sussex up to the London police court would
have been a nightmare. It was the Honourable Jim
who managed to turn it into something of a joke.</p>

<p>For all the way along the gleaming white roads, with
our headlights casting brilliant moving moons upon
the hedges, the persuasive, mocking Irish voice of the
Honourable Jim laughed and talked to the detective
who was driving us to our fate. And the conversation
of the Honourable Jim ran incessantly upon just one
theme. The mistakes that have been made by the police
in tracking down those suspected of some breach of
the law!</p>

<p>As thus. "Were you in that celebrated case, officer,
of the Downshire diamonds? Another jewel robbery,
Miss Smith! Curious how history repeats itself.
They'd got every bit of circumstantial evidence to show
that the tiara had been stolen and broken up by a
young maid-servant in the house. The 'tecs were hanging
themselves all over with whatever's their equivalent
for the D.S.O., for having got her, when the butler
owned up and showed where he'd put the thing, untouched
and wrapped up in a workman's red handkerchief,
in an old dhry well in the grounds. Mustn't it
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;313]</span>
make a man feel he ought to sing very small when he's
been caught out in a little thing like that?"</p>

<p>"That's so," said Mr. Hiram P. Jessop, with a tone
in his voice of positive gratitude. Gratitude, to the
man whom he'd been blackening and showing up, this
very afternoon! Together they seemed to be making
common cause against the detective, who was rushing
Miss Million up to town and to durance vile!</p>

<p>The detective said less than any man with whom I've
ever spent the same length of time.</p>

<p>But I believe he took it all in!</p>

<p>"Then there were the Ballycool murders, when they
were as near as dash it to hanging the wrong man,"
pursued Mr. James Burke. "Of course, that was when
my grandfather was a boy. So that particular show-up
would be before your time, officer, possibly."</p>

<p>"Eighteen Sixty-Two, sir," said the detective
briefly.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, I remember," mused the Honourable Jim,
who, I suppose, must have been born about Eighteen
Hundred and Eighty-Seven himself. "Ah, yes; but
then, some aspects of life, and love, and law don't
seem to alter much, do they?"</p>

<p>"That's correct, Mr. Burke," said Mr. Hiram P.
Jessop again in his most empressé American.</p>

<p>"Then," pursued the ineffable Irish voice as we
whizzed along, "there's that case of the Indian tray
that was missing from that wealthy bachelor's rooms&mdash;but
I misremember the exact end of that story.</p>

<p>"Plenty of them on record in this country as well as
America. I daresay you agree with me, Jessop?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;314]</span>
Mr. Jessop, sitting there in the hurrying car, seemed
to be agreeing with everything that Mr. Burke chose to
say.</p>

<p>The young American, from what glimpses I caught
of his firm, short, Dana-Gibson-like profile against the
blue night sky, was full of the tenderest and most rueful
concern for the little cousin who was involved in
this pretty kettle of fish.</p>

<p>His broad, though padded, form was sitting very close
to the minute, dejected figure of Miss Million, who had
gradually ceased to shudder and to whimper "Oh,
lor'! Oh, my! Oh, whatever is going to happen to
us now!" as she had done at the beginning of the
journey.</p>

<p>She was, I realised, a little cheered and encouraged
now. From a movement that I had noticed under Miss
Vi Vassity's sable motor-rug I guessed that Mr. Jessop
had taken his cousin's hand, and that he was holding
it as we drove.</p>

<p>Well, after all, why shouldn't he? They are cousins.</p>

<p>Also it's quite on the cards that she may accept him
yet (if we ever get out of this atrocious muddle about
the stolen ruby) as her husband!</p>

<p>These two facts make all the difference....</p>

<p>And I should have said so to the Honourable Jim had
we been alone.</p>

<p>It didn't really surprise me that he, in his turn, attempted
to hold a girl's hand under that rug.</p>

<p>Men always seem to do what they notice some other
man doing first. That must have been it. Except, of
course, that it wasn't Miss Million's hand that Mr.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;315]</span>
Burke tried to take. It was the hand of Miss Million's
maid.</p>

<p>I was determined that he shouldn't. Firmly I drew
my hand out of his clasp&mdash;it was a warm and strong
and comforting clasp enough, very magnetic; but what
of that?</p>

<p>Then I clasped my own hands tightly together, as I
am doing now, and left them on my lap, outside the
rug.</p>

<p>The Honourable Jim seemed to tire, at last, of "batting"
the detective who was driving us. He leant
back and began to sing, in a sort of musical whisper....
Really, it's unfair that a man who has the gift
of such a speaking voice should have been granted the
gift of song into the bargain. They were just little
snatches that he crooned, the sort of scraps of verse
with which he'd woken me up on the cliff that same
afternoon&mdash;bits of an Irish song called "The Snowy-breasted
Pearl," that begins:</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Oh, she is not like the rose</span><br />
<span class="i05">That proud in beauty blows&mdash;&mdash;"</span>
</div>

<p>And goes on something about:</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"And if 'tis heaven's decree</span><br />
<span class="i05">That mine she may not be&mdash;&mdash;"</span>
</div>

<p>So sweet, so tuneful, so utterly tender and touching
that&mdash;well, I know how I should have felt about him
had I been Miss Million, who three days ago considered
herself truly in love with the owner of this calling, calling
tenor voice!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;316]</span>
Had I been Miss Million, I could not have sat there
with my hand firmly and affectionately clasped in the
hand of another man, ignoring my first attraction. No;
if I had been my mistress instead of just myself, I
could not have remained so stolidly pointing out to the
Honourable Jim that all was indeed over.</p>

<p>I could not have refused him a glance, a turn of the
head in the direction of the voice that crooned so
sweetly through the purring rush of the car.</p>

<p>However, this was all&mdash;as Million herself would say&mdash;neither
here nor there. Apart from this Scotland Yard
complication, she was Miss Million, the heiress, drifting
slowly but surely in the direction of an eligible love
affair with her American cousin.</p>

<p>I had nothing whatever to do with her rejected admirer,
or how he was treated.</p>

<p>I was merely Miss Million's maid, Beatrice Lovelace,
alias Smith, with an eligible love affair of her own on
hand. How I wished my Mr. Reginald Brace could have
been anywhere get-at-able! He would have been so
splendid, so reliable!</p>

<p>He would have&mdash;well, I don't know what he could
have done, exactly. I suppose that even he could
scarcely have interfered with the carrying out of the
law! Still, I felt that it would have been a great comfort
to have had him there in that car.</p>

<p>And, as I am going to be engaged to him, there would
have been nothing incorrect in allowing him to hold my
hand. In fact, I should have done so. I hadn't got
any gloves with me, and the night air was now chill.</p>

<p>"Why, your little hands are as cold as ice, Miss
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;317]</span>
Smith," murmured Mr. James Burke to me as the car
stopped at last outside what are called the grim portals
of justice. (Plenty of grimness about the portals, anyway!)
"You ought to have kept&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Even at that awful moment he made me wonder if
he were really going to say, boldly out before the detective
and everybody: "You ought to have kept your
hands in mine as I wanted you to!"</p>

<p>But no. He had the grace to conclude smoothly and
conventionally: "You ought to have kept the rug up
about you!"</p>

<p>Then came "Good-nights"&mdash;rather a mockery under
the circumstances&mdash;and the departure of the two young
men, with a great many parting protests from Mr.
Hiram P. Jessop about the "prepassterousness" of the
whole procedure. Then we arrested "prisoners" were
taken down a loathsome stone corridor and handed over
to a&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Words fail me, as they failed Mr. Hiram P. Jessop.
I can't think of words unpleasant enough to describe
the odiousness of that particular wardress into whose
charge we were given.</p>

<p>The only excuse for her was that she imagined&mdash;why,
I don't know, for surely she could have seen that
there was nothing of that type about either Miss Million
or Miss Smith&mdash;she imagined that we were militant
Suffragettes!</p>

<p>And she certainly did make herself disagreeable to us.</p>

<p>The one mercy about this was that it braced Miss
Million up to abstain from shedding tears&mdash;which she
seemed inclined to do when we were separated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;318]</span>
Words didn't fail her! I heard the ex-maid-servant's
clearest kitchen accent announcing exactly what she
thought of "that" wardress and "that" detective, and
"that there old Rattenheimer" until stone walls and
heavy doors shut her from earshot....</p>

<p>I only hope that her rage has kept up all night, that
it's prevented her from relapsing into the misery and
terror in which she started away from the shelter of
Vi Vassity's wing at the "Refuge"! For then, I know,
she was perfectly convinced that what we were setting
out for was, at the very least, ten years' penal servitude!
Evidently Miss Million hasn't the slightest touch
of faith in the ultimate triumph of all Innocence.</p>

<p>To her, because that Rattenheimer ruby is stolen,
and she and her maid are suspected of being the thieves,
it means that it's impossible for us to be cleared!</p>

<p>I don't feel that; but I do feel the humiliation and
the discomfort of having been put in prison!</p>

<p>How many nights like the last, I wonder dismally,
am I to spend in this horrible little cell?</p>

<p>Well! I suppose this morning will show us.</p>

<p>This morning, in about an hour's time, I suppose we
are to go before the magistrate of this court, and to
answer the "serious charge" that has been brought
against us by Mr. Julius Rattenheimer.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2>

<h3>OUT ON BAIL</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">There</span>!</p>

<p>The much-dreaded ordeal is over.</p>

<p>That is, it is over for the present. For we have been
committed for trial, and that trial is still to come.</p>

<p>We shall have to go on living somehow under a cloud
of the blackest suspicion. But there's one ray of comfort
that I find among the inky gloom of my (mental)
surroundings.</p>

<p>At least, there isn't going to be any more prison
cell for us to-night! At least, I shall have a long and
perfect and much-needed sleep in my delightfully luxurious
white bed at the Hotel Cecil.</p>

<p>For that's where we've returned for the day, to pack
up a few more things before we accept Miss Vi Vassity's
kindly invitation and return to the "Refuge"&mdash;a
refuge indeed!</p>

<p>It's too good of her to welcome two suspect characters
such as my young mistress and me among her professional
friends.</p>

<p>The Breathing Statue, the Boy-Impersonator, the
Serio, the emerald-green-tighted Acrobat Lady&mdash;these
all dwell on the heights of respectability as far as their
private characters are concerned.</p>

<p>Of course, Marmora, the Twentieth-Century Hebe,
is an arrant flirt, but a girl may be that and a model
of propriety at the same time. This touch of nature
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;320]</span>
never fails to exasperate, for some reason, any of the
men who know her. The Ventriloquist's wife and the
understudy to "Cigarette" in the Number Eleven
Company of "Under Two Flags," there isn't a single
word to be said against any of them!</p>

<p>But what are we?</p>

<p>Two alleged jewel thieves, out on bail! And even
then Mrs. Rattenheimer protested loudly in court
against "those two young women" being given bail
at all!</p>

<p>By that time Miss Million and I were so utterly
crushed by all that had gone before that I verily believe
neither of us felt that we deserved to be let out at
large&mdash;no, not even though three of our friends were
sureties for us to the tune of £300 each!</p>

<p>I have come to the conclusion that it takes a born
criminal to act and look like a perfectly innocent person
when charged with a crime!</p>

<p>It's the perfectly innocent person who looks the picture
of guilt!</p>

<p>At least I know that's what poor little Miss Million
looked like as she stood beside me in the dock this
morning.</p>

<p>Her little face was as white as her handkerchief,
her grey eyes were shrunk and red with crying and
want of sleep. Her hair was "anyhow." Her small
figure seemed more insignificant than ever.</p>

<p>All the confidence with which she'd faced the wardress
last night seemed to have evaporated in those hours
of wakeful tossing on that vilely uncomfortable prison
bed. She trembled and shook. She held on to the bar
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;321]</span>
of the dock just as a very sea-sick passenger holds on
to the steamer rail. She picked at her gloves, she
nervously smoothed the creases in her pink, Bond Street
tub-frock.</p>

<p>When the magistrate addressed her she started and
gulped, and murmured "Sir" in the most utterly
stricken voice I ever heard.</p>

<p>Altogether, if ever a young woman did look as if her
sins had found her out, Miss Nellie Million, charged
with stealing a valuable ruby pendant, the property of
Mr. Julius Rattenheimer, looked the part at that moment.</p>

<p>I don't wonder the magistrate rasped at her.</p>

<p>As for me, I don't think I looked quite as frightened.
You can't be at the same moment frightened and very
angry.</p>

<p>I felt like murder; whom I should have wished to
murder I don't quite know&mdash;the owner of the ruby alone
would not have been enough for me. I was inwardly
foaming with rage over having been forced into
this idiotic position; also for having been made,
not only mentally, but physically and acutely uncomfortable.</p>

<p>This is only one detail of the discomfort, but this
may serve to sum up the rest; for the very first time
in the whole of my life I'd had to go without my morning
bath, and to stand fully dressed, but with the consciousness
of being untubbed and unscrubbed, facing the
world!</p>

<p>There was such a horrible lot of the world to face,
too, in that awful police-court, where the windows were
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;322]</span>
steaming and opaque, and the walls clammy as those of
an uncared-for country vestry!</p>

<p>The place seemed crowded with all sorts and conditions
of men and women, lumped together, so to speak,
in Fate's lucky-bag. And it was only after I'd given
two or three resentful glances about that stuffy cave
of a place that I recognised among all the strangers the
faces of the people who'd come to back up Miss Million
and me.</p>

<p>First and foremost, of course, there sat, as close to
us as she could manage to get herself placed, the sumptuous,
peg-top-shaped, white-clad figure of London's
Love, Miss Vi Vassity, with her metallic hair.</p>

<p>She kissed her plump hand to us with effusion, waving
encouragingly to us with her big gold mesh bag
and all its glittering, clashing attachments: the cigarette
case, the lip-salve tube, the gold pencil, the memorandum
tablets, the Darin powder-box, the card-case,
the Swastika, the lucky pig, the touchwood, the gold-tipped
coral charm, the threepenny bit, and all the other
odd things that rattled and jingled together like a pedlar's
cart, making an unearthly stir in court.</p>

<p>From where I stood I could see two men sketching
the owner of all this clatter!</p>

<p>Close beside her sat Mr. Hiram P. Jessop, very boyish,
very grave; his well-cut Dana-Gibson mouth seeming
to be permanently set into the exclamation, "Preppassterous!"
and his serious eyes fastened on his trembling
little cousin in the dock.</p>

<p>The Honourable James Burke sat behind them. All
the policemen and officials, I noticed, were being as
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;323]</span>
pleasant and deferential to that young scamp as if he
were at least a judge, instead of a person who ought
by rights to be locked up in the interests of the public!</p>

<p>To the right of him sat the author of all our troubles,
Mr. Julius Rattenheimer.</p>

<p>I suppose all German Jews aren't odious! I suppose
all German Jews aren't thick-nosed and oily skinned,
with eyes like two blackberries sunk very deep in a pan
of dough! I suppose they don't all run to "bulges"
inside their waistcoats and over their collars, and above
and below their flashing rings? I suppose they don't
all talk with their hands?</p>

<p>No, I suppose it isn't fair to judge the whole race by
one specimen.</p>

<p>He became wildly excited during the proceedings.
Four or five times he interrupted the reading of the
charge. He gesticulated, pointing at Miss Million, and
crying: "Yes! Yes! She's in the pay of this udder
one. Do you see? This girl Smith, that we find out
has an assumed name, vot? Easy to see who is the
head of the firma&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes; she is the beauty vot would not have her
boxes looked at. Coming to a hotel mit empty boxes,
vot does that look like, yes? Two young girls, very
shabby, and presently tog demselves out in the most
sexbensive clothes. How they get them, no?"</p>

<p>The magistrate broke in severely with something
about "What Mr. Rattenheimer had to say would be attended
to presently."</p>

<p>"I say get the girl, and do not let her to be at large
whoever say they will pay for her. Get this woman
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;324]</span>
Lovelace; she is the one we want," vociferated the awful
little Hebrew; a little later on I think it was, but the
whole police-court scene is one hideous confusion to me
now. "Don't let her to esgabe through our hands, this
girl, Beatrice Lovelace&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>My name, my real name, seemed to echo and resound
all through that dreadful place. I didn't know before
that I had always, at the bottom of my heart, been
proud of the old name.</p>

<p>Yes! Even if it has been brought down to belonging
to a family of nouveaux-pauvres, who are neither
fish, fowl, nor good red herring. Even if it is like having
a complete motoring-kit, and no earthly chance of
ever possessing a motor to wear it in!</p>

<p>Even so, it's a name that belonged to generation
after generation of brave fighters; men who have served
under Nelson and Wellington, Clive and Roberts!</p>

<p>It's their blood, theirs and that of the women who
loved them, that ran hot and angry in my veins to-day,
flushing my cheeks with scarlet fury to hear that name
profaned in the mouth of a little stuttering, jewel-grabbing
alien, who's never had a sword, or even a rifle, in
his hand!</p>

<p>I turned my indignant eyes from him. And my eyes
met, across the court, the eyes of another woman who
wears the name of Lovelace!</p>

<p>Heavens! There was my Aunt Anastasia, sitting
bolt upright in the gallery and listening to the case.
Her face was whiter than Million's, and her lips were
an almost imperceptible line across it!</p>

<p>How did she know? How had she come there? I
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;325]</span>
didn't at that moment realise the truth&mdash;namely, that
the Scotland Yard officials had been busy with their inquiries,
not only at what Miss Million calls the Hotel
"Sizzle," but also at what used to be my home at No.
45 Laburnum Grove, Putney, S.W.</p>

<p>Poor Aunt Anastasia, hearing that her niece was
"wanted by the police" for robbery, must have received
a shock forty times worse than that of my letter
informing her that I had become our ex-servant's maid!</p>

<p>But, as I say, here she was in court ... seeing the
pair of us in the dock, listening to the account of the
circumstances that really did look black against us.</p>

<p>Oh, that unfortunate flight of Miss Million's into
Sussex! That still more unfortunate flight of her
maid's after her, leaving no address!</p>

<p>Aunt Anastasia, in pale horror, was listening to it
all. That was the last straw.</p>

<p>It seemed to me nothing after that when, from where
I stood tense in the dock, I recognised in the blurred
pink speckle of faces against the grimy walls of the
court the face of another person that I knew.</p>

<p>A blonde, manly face, grave as that of the young
American, but with a less unself-conscious gravity.</p>

<p>The face of Mr. Reginald Brace, the manager of
Miss Million's bank, who wants to be the manager of
me&mdash;no! I mustn't make these cheap jokes about the
steady and sterling and utterly English character of the
young man who loves me and who wishes&mdash;still wishes!&mdash;to
marry me.</p>

<p>For he has behaved in a way that ought to take any
wish to make jokes about him away from any girl!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;326]</span>
He has been so splendid&mdash;so "decent"!</p>

<p>You know, when bail was asked for, he stepped forward&mdash;he
who is usually so deliberate in his movements!&mdash;quite
as quickly as the Honourable Jim. How he&mdash;the
Honourable Jim&mdash;had £300 to dispose of at a moment's
notice is one of these mysteries that I suppose
I never shall solve.</p>

<p>Still, he is one of the sureties for us, and my Mr.
Brace is another. The third is Miss Vi Vassity, who
produced, "to dazzle the old boy," a rustling sheaf of
notes and a sliding, gleaming handful of sovereigns from
the gold mesh bag, as well as her blue cheque-book and
a smile that was a perfect guarantee of opulence.</p>

<p>Let me see, what came next? We were "released,"
of course, and I remember standing on the pavement
outside the doors of that detestable place, I still holding
Miss Million mechanically by the arm and finding
ourselves the centre of a group of our friends.</p>

<p>The group surrounding us two criminals on the pavement
outside the police-court consisted of Miss Vi Vassity,
who was very showy, cheery, and encouraging;
Mr. Hiram P. Jessop, very protective of his cousin;
the Honourable James Burke; Mr. Brace, and one or
two theatrical people who had recognised London's
Love, and had come over to exchange loud greetings
with her.</p>

<p>On the outskirts of this talking, gesticulating crowd
of people there appeared a tall, rigidly erect feminine
figure in grey tweed, and a black hat that managed to
be at the same time unutterably frumpy and "the hat
of a lady."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;327]</span>
It was, of course, the hat of my Aunt Anastasia.
Over the upholstered shoulder of Miss Million's American
cousin I caught her eye. I then saw her thin lips
pronouncing my name:</p>

<p>"Beatrice."</p>

<p>I moved away from Mr. Burke, who was standing
very close to me, and went up to her. What to say to
her I did not know.</p>

<p>But she spoke first, in the very quiet, very concentrated
tone of voice that she always used in the old days
when I was "in for a row."</p>

<p>"Beatrice, you will come home with me at once."</p>

<p>It was not so much an order as a stated fact. People
who put their wishes in that way are not accustomed
to be disobeyed.</p>

<p>My Aunt Anastasia didn't think for one moment that
I should disobey her. She imagined that I should at
once leave this crowd of extraordinary people, for I
saw her glance of utter disapproval sweeping them all!
She imagined that I should return with her to the little
nouveau-pauvre villa at Putney and listen like a lamb
to all she had to say.</p>

<p>Six months ago I should have done this, of course.
But now&mdash;too much had happened in between. I had
seen too many other people, too many aspects of life
that was not the tiny stereoscopic view of things as they
appear to the Aunt Anastasias of this world.</p>

<p>I realised that I was a woman, and that this other
woman, who had dominated me for so long, had no
claim upon me now.</p>

<p>I said gently and quietly, but quite firmly: "I am
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;328]</span>
very sorry, Aunt Anastasia, but I can't come just now."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Beatrice?" this icily. "You
don't seem to see that you are singularly fortunate in
having a home still open to you," said my aunt.
"After the disgrace that you have brought, this morning,
upon our family&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What's all this? What's all this?" broke in the
cheerful, unabashed voice of Miss Vi Vassity.</p>

<p>That lady had broken away from her theatrical
friends&mdash;young men with soft hats and clean-cut features&mdash;and,
accompanied by her usual inevitable jingle
of gold hanging charms and toys and knick-knacks&mdash;had
turned to me.</p>

<p>She caught my arm in her plump, white-gloved hand
and beamed good-naturedly upon my frozen aunt.</p>

<p>"Who's your lady friend, Smithie, my dear?" demanded
London's Love, who had never looked more
showily vulgar.</p>

<p>The grimy background of street and police-court
walls seemed to throw up the sudden ins-and-outs of
her sumptuous, rather short-legged figure, topped by
that glittering hair and finished off by a pair of fantastically
high-heeled French boots of the finest and
whitest kid.</p>

<p>No wonder my fastidious aunt gazed upon her with
that petrified look!</p>

<p>London's Love didn't seem to see it. She went on
gaily: "Didn't half fill the stalls, our party this morning,
what, what? Might have been 'some' divorce case!
Now for a spot of lunch to wash it all down. We're
all going on to the Cecil. Come on, Jim," to Mr. Burke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;329]</span>
"Come on&mdash;I didn't catch your boy's name, Miss
Smith&mdash;yours, I mean," tapping the arm of Mr. Reginald
Brace, who looked very nearly as frozen as my
aunt herself. "Still, you'll come. And you, dear?"</p>

<p>This to no less a person than Miss Anastasia Lovelace.</p>

<p>"This is my aunt, Miss Lovelace," I put in hurriedly.
"Aunt Anastasia, this is Miss Vassity, who,
as you said, was kind enough to&mdash;to go bail for us just
now in court&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The bend of my aunt's neck and frumpy hat towards
Miss Vi Vassity was something more crushingly frigid
than the cut direct would have been.</p>

<p>Still London's Love took it all in good part; holding
out that plump white paw of hers, and taking my aunt's
untendered hand warmly into her own.</p>

<p>"Pleased to meet you," she said heartily. "Your
little niece here is a great pal o' mine. I was sorry
to see her in a mess. Shockin' naughty girl, though,
isn't she? Nickin' rubies. Tut, tut. Why didn't you
bring her up better, eh?" suggested England's Premier
Comedienne.</p>

<p>There are absolutely no words to describe the deepening
of the horror on poor Aunt Anastasia's face as
she looked and listened and "took in" generally the
society in which her only niece found herself!</p>

<p>Miss Vi Vassity's loud, gay tones seemed to permeate
that group and that situation just as a racing wave
ripples over pebbles and seaweed and sand-castles alike.</p>

<p>"Girls will be girls! I never intend to be anything
else myself," announced the artiste joyously. "You're
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;330]</span>
coming along with her, Miss&mdash;Lovelace, is it? Pretty
stage name that 'ud make, boys. 'Miss Love Lace,'
eh? Look dandy on the bills. You'll sit next your
young niece here, and see she don't go slipping any
of the spoons off the table inside her camisole. You
never know what's going to go next with these kleptomaniacs.
Er&mdash;hur!"</p>

<p>She gave a little exaggerated cough. "I'll have to
keep my own eye on the other jewel thief, Nellie Million&mdash;d'you
know her?"</p>

<p>Here I saw my aunt's cold, grey eye seeming to go
straight through the face and form of the girl who
used to be her maid-of-all-work.</p>

<p>Miss Million, in her rather crushed but very "good"-looking
pink linen gown, held her small head high and
glared back defiantly at the woman who used to
take her to task for having failed to keep a wet clean
handkerchief over the butter-dish. She (my mistress)
seemed to gain confidence and poise as soon as she stood
near the large, grey-clad figure of her American cousin.</p>

<p>All through this the voice of Miss Vi Vassity rippled
on. "I'd better introduce the gentleman. This is Mr.
Hiram P. Jessop, the inventor. I don't mean 'liar.'
One o' those is enough in a party, eh, Jim? This is
the Honourable Mr. James Burke, of Ballyneck Castle.
This is Mr. Brace. Now we're all here; come
along&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thank you very much, but I think I will say 'Good
morning,'" broke in my aunt's most destructively polite
tones. "Come, Beatrice. I am taking my niece with
me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;331]</span>
Here there occurred that of which I am sure Miss
Million has often dreamed, both when she was a little,
twenty-pound-a-year maid-of-all-work and lately, since
she's been the heiress of a fortune.</p>

<p>She struck!</p>

<p>She, once dependent upon every order from those
thin, aristocratic lips of Miss Anastasia Lovelace's,
gave her own order to her own ex-mistress.</p>

<p>"Very sorry, Miss Lovelace, but I can't spare your
niece to go with you just now," she announced, in her
"that-settles-it" sounding Cockney accent. "I want
her to change me for luncheon.</p>

<p>"Friday is her afternoon out," enlarged Miss Million,
encouraging herself with an upward glance into
the grave, boyish, American face of her cousin, and
speaking more authoritatively still. "I can't have her
gallivanting off to you nor to any one else just this
minute. It's not convenient. She's my maid now, you
see&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>My aunt's glance was that of a basilisk, her tone
like the cut of a whip, as she retorted coldly: "My
niece has nothing more to do with you. She will leave
you at once. She is no longer in your&mdash;your grotesque
service."</p>

<p>"My service is as good as yours was, and a fat lot
better, I can tell you, Miss Lovelace," riposted my mistress,
becoming suddenly shrill and flushed. "I give
the girl sixty pounds a year, and take her about
with me to all my own friends, same as if she was my
sister.</p>

<p>"Yes. You needn't look like that because I do.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;332]</span>
Ask her. The first time in her life she's ever had a
good time is now, since she's been working for some
one that does realise that a girl's got to have her bit
of fun and liberty same as everybody else, be she
duchess or be she lady's-maid!"</p>

<p>"She is a lady's-maid no longer," said my Aunt
Anastasia, in a voice that shook. The others looked
fearfully uncomfortable, all except Miss Vi Vassity,
who seemed to be hanging with the keenest enjoyment
upon every syllable that fell from the lips of the two
"opposing parties."</p>

<p>"My niece is no longer a lady's-maid," repeated
Aunt Anastasia. "She leaves your service here and
now."</p>

<p>"Not without notice," said the stubborn Million, in
a voice that brought the whole of our inconvenient little
Putney kitchen before my mental gaze. Verily she had
recovered from her bad attack of stage-fright in court
just before.</p>

<p>"A girl's got to give her month's notice or to give
up a month's wages," said my Aunt Anastasia with a
curling lip. "That is easily settled. My niece is in no
need of a month's wages from some one who is&mdash;charged
with common theft&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why, she's 'charged' herself, as far as that goes!"
Million gave back quickly. "If I've taken that old
ruby, my maid knows all about it, and she's in it with
me! You heard for yourself, Miss Lovelace, what that
old Rattenheimer said in there just now. It's her he
suspects&mdash;your niece! It's her he didn't want to let
go, bail or no bail!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;333]</span>
What a wrangle!</p>

<p>It was a most inappropriate place for a wrangle, I
know. But there they still stood and wrangled in the
open street outside the police-station, ex-mistress and
ex-maid, while passers-by stared curiously at them, and
I and the three young men stood by, wondering what
in the world would be said next.</p>

<p>"A month's wages, too!" repeated my young mistress,
with the snorting laugh with which she used to
rout the butcher-boys of Putney.</p>

<p>"It's a fat lot more than a month's wages that's
doo from your niece to me, Miss Lovelace, and so I tell
you! Two quarters' salary. That's what I've advanced
my maid, so's she could get herself the sort of
rig-out that she fancied. First time in her life the
girl's been turned out like a young lady."</p>

<p>Here Miss Million waved a hand towards my perfectly
cut black, taking in every detail from the small
hat to the delight-giving silk stockings and suède
shoes.</p>

<p>"Yes, for all her aristocratic relations they never
done that for her&mdash;why, you know what a pretty girl
you said she was, Vi"&mdash;turning upon London's Love,
who nodded appreciatively.</p>

<p>"Well, you wouldn't ha' known her if you'd seen
her in any old duds like she used to have to wear when
she was only 'my niece'"&mdash;here a vindictive and quite
good imitation of my Aunt Anastasia's voice.</p>

<p>"Now there's some shape in her"&mdash;this is good,
from Million, who's picked up everything about clothes
from me!&mdash;"and who's she got to thank for it? Me,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;334]</span>
and my good wages," concluded my mistress, with unction.
"Me, and my thirty pounds that I advanced her
in the first week. She can't go&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't want to!" I put in, but Miss Million
grimaced me into silence. She meant to have her say,
her own, long-deferred say, out.</p>

<p>"She can't go without she pays up what's owing
to me first," declared my mistress triumphantly. "So
what's she going to do?"</p>

<p>This certainly was a "poser" to poor Aunt Anastasia.</p>

<p>Full well I knew that she had not thirty pounds in
the world that she could produce at a moment's or even
at a month's notice.</p>

<p>Her tiny income is so tied up that she cannot touch
the capital. And I know that, careful as she is, there
is never more than twelve pounds between herself and a
pauper's grave, so to speak.</p>

<p>I saw her turn a little whiter where she stood. She
darted at me a glance of the deadliest reproach. I had
brought her to this! To being worsted by a little
jumped-up maid-servant!</p>

<p>Million, I must say, made the most of the situation.
"There y'are, you see," she exulted. "Your niece has
gone and spent all that money. And you haven't got
it to reimburse it. You can't pay up! Ar! Those that
give 'emselves the airs of being the Prince of Wales and
all the Royal Family, and there's nothing they can't
do&mdash;they ought to make sure that they have something
to back it up with before they start!"</p>

<p>So true! So horribly true&mdash;poor Aunt Anastasia!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;335]</span>
She said in her controlled voice: "The money shall
certainly be paid. I will write."</p>

<p>I saw her face a mask of worry, and then she turned
away.</p>

<p>As she walked down the street towards the Strand
again, I saw her sway once, a little.</p>

<p>"Oh," I exclaimed involuntarily, "she ought not to
walk. I don't believe she's well. She ought not to be
alone, perhaps&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>And I turned to the young man to whom I suppose
I have a right to turn, since he has asked me to marry
him. At that moment I felt that it was such a comfort
he was there; steady and reliable and conscientious.</p>

<p>"Mr. Brace!" I appealed to him a little shyly. "If
you would be so kind! I wonder if you would mind&mdash;I'm
afraid I shall have to ask you to take my aunt
home?"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;er&mdash;yes, I should be delighted," said Mr.
Brace quickly, but flushing all over his blonde face
and looking suddenly and acutely miserable.</p>

<p>It was a great astonishment to me that the young
man wasn't off to carry out this wish of mine before
it had finished leaving my lips. Still, it wasn't his
fault at all. Oh, no; I see his point of view quite well.</p>

<p>"That is&mdash;Do you think, perhaps, that your aunt
might not find it distasteful to be addressed by me?
You see the last time she spoke to me, it was&mdash;er&mdash;not
on the friendliest terms, and&mdash;er&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Aw, look here, Mr. Brace, don't you worry!" broke
in the joyously, matter-of-fact voice of London's Love.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;336]</span>
"You stay with your young lady and come on to lunch.
Her aunt's being attended to all right without you.
Look at that!"</p>

<p>"That" was certainly an unexpected scene towards
which Miss Vi Vassity waved her tightly gloved hand.</p>

<p>I gazed in wonder in that direction.</p>

<p>There, on the pavement at the end of the turning
into the Strand, stood the scraggy, erect, grey-clad,
frumpily hatted figure of my Aunt Anastasia. And beside
her, close beside her, was the Honourable James
Burke! He must have broken away from the group
almost at the moment that she did, and gone up to her.</p>

<p>What could he have said?</p>

<p>The "cheek" of that man! Is there anybody that
he wouldn't mind tackling?</p>

<p>For he was leaning confidentially towards my so forbidding
aunt. He was talking fluently to her about
something. He was smiling down at her&mdash;I caught the
curve of his cheek in profile.</p>

<p>And&mdash;could it be true?&mdash;my Aunt Anastasia actually
didn't mind him!</p>

<p>I only saw her back; but you know how expressive
backs can be. And the usually rigid, flat shoulders with
the Victorian corset-ridge, and the lady-like waist and
scarcely existent hips of my aunt were positively expressing
mollification, friendliness, gratification!</p>

<p>"The old girl's all right with Jim to look after her,"
said Miss Vi Vassity, cheerfully to me, adding, with a
large wink: "What worked the trick with her was the
cue 'Ballyneck Castle,' I bet you. Me and Nellie and
the rest of us weren't quite class enough for her ladyship.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;337]</span>
But you can't go wrong with these old Irish
kings! So little known about 'em. Eh, Hiram? There!
Milord has got a taxi for Auntie Lovelace"&mdash;which was
surprisingly true.</p>

<p>"Got off with her, hasn't he?" laughed London's
Love. "S'prised at her at her time o' life. Still, there's
no fool like an old fool. I ought to know; nothing at 85
can resist little Me. Now, then, lunch at last. I guess
you're all fairly perishing."</p>

<p>We were.</p>

<p>But there was one picture that remained with me
even after we all got to the Cecil and the whole party&mdash;including
Miss Million's maid&mdash;were sitting greedily
concentrating upon the menu at one of the round tables
in the big dining-room.</p>

<p>This was the picture of my Aunt Anastasia whirling
towards Putney in that taxi&mdash;she who never, never can
afford the luxury of a cab!&mdash;accompanied by the Honourable
James Burke!</p>

<p>What would that drive be like? What would that
unscrupulous young Irishman say to her, and she to
him?</p>

<p>Would she ask him into No. 45? And&mdash;would
he go?</p>

<p>Would she ask questions about her niece, Miss Million's
maid, and would he answer them?</p>

<p>Oh! How I long to know these things! My wish
for that is so keen that it causes me to forget even
the black fog of suspicion under which my mistress
and I will have to move while we are still "on bail."
How I wish the Honourable Jim would hurry up and
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;338]</span>
come back, just so that I could hear all about his tête-à-tête
with my aunt!</p>

<p>But as it is, there's plenty to occupy me. A delicious
lunch before me to make up for no dinner the night before,
and a prison breakfast this morning!</p>

<p>At the head of the table Miss Vi Vassity, with her
stream of comment as cheering and bright as the
Bubbley in our glasses, which she insisted on standing
all round! Beside me my very eligible and nice would-be
fiancé, Mr. Reginald Brace, a young man that any
girl ought to be glad to be sitting next.</p>

<p>I don't mean "ought," of course. I mean "would."
I was, I know.</p>

<p>Mr. Brace was so kind, and tried all the time to be
so sympathetic and helpful. I shall never forget his
goodness. And he was really most apologetic about
not having rushed to help Aunt Anastasia the minute I
said anything about it.</p>

<p>"You see, I really think she would have preferred
not to speak to me," he said. Then anxiously: "You
are not annoyed with me, Miss Lovelace? You don't
feel I could have done anything else?"</p>

<p>"Of course, you couldn't," I said.</p>

<p>"It seems too bad, the first time you asked me to
do anything," he muttered over his plate. "I who
want so to do things for you."</p>

<p>"Oh, please don't," I said quickly.</p>

<p>He said: "I am afraid you are a little annoyed with
me, Beatrice&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Indeed I'm not," I protested through all the racket
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;339]</span>
of Vi Vassity's talk above the pretty flowery table,
"only&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Only what?"</p>

<p>"Well, I don't think I said you might call me that,"
I said, colouring.</p>

<p>He lowered his voice and said earnestly: "Are you
going to say I may? I know it's not yet quite a week
since I asked you. But couldn't I have my answer before
that? I want so to take you away from all these
people."</p>

<p>There was an expression of the most ungrateful disgust
on his fair, Puritan sort of face as he turned it for
a moment from me to that of the bubbling-over music-hall
artiste who was his hostess.</p>

<p>"None of these people are fit," he declared resentfully,
"to associate with you."</p>

<p>"You forget that plenty of people might not think
I was fit to associate with! A girl who is arrested for
jewel robbery!"</p>

<p>"Your own fault, Miss Lovelace, if I may say so!
If you hadn't been here with Miss Million"&mdash;another
ungrateful glance&mdash;"this suspicion wouldn't have
touched you."</p>

<p>"If I hadn't brought Miss Million here, it wouldn't
have touched her!"</p>

<p>"That has nothing to do with it," he said quite
fretfully. Men generally are fretful, I notice, when
women score a point in common sense.</p>

<p>It's so unexpected.</p>

<p>"The question still is&mdash;Are you going to make me
the happiest man in the world by marrying me?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;340]</span>
It's odd what a difference there is between one's first
proposal of marriage&mdash;and one's second!</p>

<p>Yes! Even if they are from the same man, as mine
were. The first time is much the better.</p>

<p>A girl is prouder, more touched by it. She is possessed
by the feeling "Ah, I am really not worth all
this! I don't deserve to have a really splendid young
man thinking as much of me as Dick, or Tom, or Harry,
or Reginald, or whoever it is does."</p>

<p>I am only an ordinary sort of girl. I'm not one
quarter as pretty, or as nice, or as sweet-tempered, or
as affectionate, or as domesticated, or as good with
my needle, or as likely to make a good wife as thousands
of other girls who would be only too glad to
have him!</p>

<p>Yet it's me he chooses. It's me he loves. It's me he
called "The One Girl in the World for Him."</p>

<p>That may be a little obvious, but, oh, how wonderful!
Even if a girl didn't want to say "Yes" the first
minute she was asked, she simply couldn't help feeling
pleased and flattered and uplifted to the seventh
heaven by the mere fact that he'd proposed.</p>

<p>Some girls never get a proposal at all. I'm really
fearfully lucky to have him look at me!</p>

<p>That's the first time, my dears.</p>

<p>As for the second time&mdash;well! I can only go by my
own feelings with regard to Mr. Reginald Brace.</p>

<p>And these are: Well! He must like me dreadfully
much to have proposed to me so soon again. He must
adore me! I suppose I must be rather nice to look at,
since he thinks I am "beautiful."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;341]</span>
It's very nice and kind of him to want to marry me
at once; very gratifying. But why does he want to
take me away from the society of a whole lot of amusing
friends, because he thinks they are "not good
enough" for me?</p>

<p>Is he so much better? Is he? He may have a less
Cockney voice, and a less flamboyant style of good
looks than Miss Vi Vassity and her theatrical friends.</p>

<p>But he can't have a kinder heart. Nobody could.
And he hasn't any quicker wits&mdash;that I've seen for myself.</p>

<p>It was magnificent of him to come to the court and
to go bail for Miss Million and me directly he heard
that we were suspected of robbery.</p>

<p>But, still&mdash;&mdash;He must have known that we were
innocent. Miss Million is a client of his, and he knows
all about my people. I think a good deal of him for
sticking to us. But I should have despised him if he
hadn't. I like him. But, after all, when a girl says
she'll marry a man, she means, or ought to mean, that
he appeals to her more than any man she's ever met in
her life.</p>

<p>It means she's sure she never will meet a man she
could like more. It means he's the type of looks she
likes, the kind of voice she loves to listen to, all the
mental and physical qualities that call, softly, to something
in her, saying:</p>

<p>"Here! Come to me. Come! It may be to settle
down for life in a tiny suburban villa with one bed of
calceolarias in the back garden and the kitchen range
continually out of sorts. It may be to a life of following
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;342]</span>
the drum from one outpost of the Empire to another.
It may be to a country rectory, or to a ranch
in Canada&mdash;"</p>

<p>I don't know what put the idea of a Canadian ranch
into my head. But lots of people do marry into them.</p>

<p>"&mdash;or to a house in Park Lane, or to a bungalow
in India. But wherever it is, wherever I am, that's
home! Come!"</p>

<p>At least, ought one to feel like that, or oughtn't
one? I don't know. Life and love are very complicated
and confusing matters&mdash;especially love.</p>

<p>I told Mr. Brace so. This was just as we were rising
from the luncheon-table. I said hurriedly: "I can't
answer you. I really must have more time to think it
over."</p>

<p>His fair Puritan's face fell at this, and he looked
at me reproachfully.</p>

<p>"More time?" he said discontentedly. "More time
still?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I&mdash;I'm sure it's most important," I said
earnestly. "Everybody ought to have lots and lots
of time to think it over before they dream of getting
engaged. I'm sure that's the right thing."</p>

<p>And then our party broke up, for Miss Vi Vassity
was going on to a theatrical garden fête to sell boxes
of nougat with a signed photograph of herself on the
lid, and Mr. Hiram P. Jessop wanted to take his cousin
out into the park for a long talk about his aerial bomb-dropper,
he said, and Mr. Brace had to get back to the
bank.</p>

<p>Miss Million said I could go out for a breath of
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;343]</span>
air if I wanted, but I had to return to Miss Million's
rooms upstairs and to set things a little bit in order
there, as well as packing up for our next flight to the
"Refuge."</p>

<p>Perhaps the Honourable Jim may call and tell me
how he got on with my Aunt Anastasia?</p>

<p>No! There has been no sign of him all the afternoon.
It has gone quietly and slowly. My talkative
friend, the telephone girl, threw me a smile and a glance
only a little sharper than usual as I crossed the hall.
The hurrying page-boys in brown, the porters look just
the same as usual; the coming and going of the American
visitors is the same.</p>

<p>Life here in the big hotel seems resumed for me exactly
where it was broken off the day that Miss Million's
disappearance coincided with the disappearance
of the celebrated Rattenheimer ruby. Ugh!... Except
for my ineffaceable memories of last night and this
morning in the police-court there's nothing to remind
me that my mistress and I are still in that horrible and
extraordinary situation, "out on bail."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>

<h3>MILLION BUCKS UP</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Miss Million</span> has returned, her troubles for the moment
forgotten; her small face rosy from the sunshine
and the outdoor air; also as radiant as if no Assizes
loomed before us in a few weeks' time.</p>

<p>"You'll be glad to hear, Smith, that I've settled
what to do about all that fuss and botheration about
the money," she told me as I knelt beside her on the
carpet, unfastening her grey suède shoes. "Me and
my cousin have fixed that up."</p>

<p>"Have you?" I said, delightedly glancing up at
her, and pausing with one of her small but dumpy feet
in my hand. "Have you really settled it with Mr.
Jessop? Oh, I am so glad! I hope," here I gave an
affectionate little squeeze to that grey, silk-sheathed
foot, "I do hope you'll be very happy."</p>

<p>"Well, he will, that's pretty certain," said Miss Million
in her most matter-of-fact tone of voice; "but
whether I will is another matter.</p>

<p>"All depends upon whether this here bomb-dropper
turns out a good investment or a wild-goose chase.
'Twouldn't surprise me a bit if it did that. Still! He's
been talking to me again about it this afternoon, explaining
it all while we sat on two green wooden chairs
under the trees on the grass, as grave as two judges.
And I'm taking the chance."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;345]</span>
"I think you're so right!" I said enthusiastically.
"I'm quite sure he's exactly the sort of husband for
you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Husbands?" echoed Miss Million, and gazed at me
stonily. "Who's talking of husbands?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;&mdash;Aren't you?" I exclaimed, utterly taken
aback. "Don't you mean&mdash;&mdash;When you said you'd
fixed it up with Mr. Jessop didn't you mean you'd said
you'd marry him?"</p>

<p>"Ow! Now!" ejaculated Million in her Cockniest
voice, vigorously shaking her little dark head.
"Marry him? Not much! When I said I'd fixed it up
I meant I was going to 'come in' with the money to
float this here invention of his. No going to Lawr at
all. I shall just pay him over so much.</p>

<p>"We'll get old Mr. Chesterton to arrange about that,
and let him do the best he can. We're goin' shares,
and we're going to share profits in what he makes over
the thing&mdash;if anything. He seems to me just like a
boy we sor in Kensington Gardens when we was out; a
boy with a model yacht, mad with joy over the machinery
of it, and the what-not!</p>

<p>"That's just like my cousin Hiram. Men are kids!"
added Miss Million with a profound smile.</p>

<p>I looked at her with surprise as I fetched her little
indoor slippers. "And you're giving him the money
to play with this yacht of his?"</p>

<p>"Yes. He talked me round to that," said my mistress.
"But talk me round into marrying him into
the bargain was a thing he couldn't do."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;346]</span>
"Why not?" I ventured. "You like him. He's
nice&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes. But marriage! Not for me," said Miss Million,
again shaking her dark head. "I've been thinking
it well out, and that's what I've come to. I'm better
single. I've plenty of money, even after I've paid
Hiram all he wants for the blessed machine&mdash;sounds
like a sewing machine on the hire system, don't it?</p>

<p>"As I am, I'm my own mistress," said our little
ex-maid-servant exultantly. "Go where I like, do what
I like&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Except for being arrested and put into prison," I
put in ruefully.</p>

<p>"Ow! That about the old ruby. Hiram'll fix that
yet, see if he don't," said Miss Million, in tones of
pride&mdash;family pride, I suppose.</p>

<p>"But, as I was saying, while I'm single I can go
about as I choose, nobody saying a word to me. And
nobody can twit me with being an old maid, neither,
for when a lady's got money there's no such thing!
So there's one reason gone why she should worry to get
married. After all, what does a gel get married for,
mostly?"</p>

<p>I waited expectantly.</p>

<p>"Home of her own," went on Miss Million oracularly.
"And I can get that any day of the week.
Two or three I can get. I've been looking at some o'
these illustrated ad-verts in the papers.</p>

<p>"And, Smith, d'you know there's a place down in
Wales that u'd suit me down to the ground if I want a
bit of a change, furnished and all. I always liked the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;347]</span>
idea of Wales. I'll ask Hiram's advice about that
house."</p>

<p>This reminded me of another young man who had
once hoped to have his advice asked for on subjects of
this nature by the little heiress before me. Poor Mr.
Burke, once hero-worshipped by this funny little Dollar
Princess!</p>

<p>I couldn't understand her.</p>

<p>I had to remind her gently: "It isn't only a home
of her own, surely, that a girl's thinking of when she
gets married. I&mdash;I never thought you thought so,
either, Miss Million. What about&mdash;what about being
in love with the man?"</p>

<p>Hereupon my young mistress, sitting there on the
corner of the pink hotel couch, proceeded to give me
some (changed) views of her own on the subject of love.</p>

<p>"It's all very well, but love is not what it's cracked
up to be in those tales out of the Celandine novelettes
that I used ter be so fonder readin'," she said decidedly.
"The fack is, I've had some. Look how gone
I was on that Mr. Burke. Fair sloppin' over with love,
as they call it."</p>

<p>"Miss Million, dear, do try not to talk quite so&mdash;err&mdash;quite
like that," I ventured mildly. But my mistress
was no longer to be guided by what I thought
suitable or unsuitable expressions to come from the
mouth of a young lady of fortune.</p>

<p>"Hiram thinks I talk lovely, and what's good enough
for him ought to be good enough for the rest of the
people I'm likely to meet, so I'm not goin' to break my
neck no more trying to talk like your Aunt Nasturtium,"
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;348]</span>
announced Million defiantly. "I'm goin' to
talk straight, the way it comes natchrul to me. Now
about this love. As I say, I been let down once with it.
And once bit, twice shy. I'm not goin' to let myself get
buzzed, as Vi calls it, no second time. S'no use any
more good-lookin' young gentlemanly men comin' round
to try and get on the soft side of Nellie Million, and
fillin' her up with a lot of Tales of Hoffmann jest because
she happens to have a bit of her own. That
was a shock to me, Smith, that was. That about the
Honourable Mr. Burke being such a liar. It's a good
job, in a way. Because it's put me off love for life!"</p>

<p>"I wonder," I said, standing there, and looking
thoughtfully down at the well-dressed, sturdy little
figure with the black hair that I can still see looking
neat and glossy under a cap. "If it has done that, it
may, as you say, be 'a good job.' But it might be&mdash;a
great pity!"</p>

<p>"Ar, go on. Don't you believe that, Miss Kid," returned
my mistress with a funny little echo of England's
Premier Comedienne in her voice. "Love's all right
for anybody that hasn't got anything else to hope for,
and that's about as much as you can say for it. But
what about yourself, Smith?"</p>

<p>Here my mistress's bright grey eyes gave me a very
straight glance.</p>

<p>"What about our young Mr. Brace, him from the
bank? I sor him in court, and it wasn't at me he was
looking at all. Then there was at lunch to-day. Several
times Vi has passed the remark about him and you
being very thick&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;349]</span>
I repressed a wish to check this expression. After
all, if "Hiram" considers it lovely, and it comes
"natchrul" to Miss Million, why should I worry any
longer about her flowers of speech?</p>

<p>She then put a "straight" question:</p>

<p>"Has that young gentleman bin makin' up to you?"</p>

<p>I answered her in a "straight" manner:</p>

<p>"Yes. He has. He's asked me to marry him."</p>

<p>"Oh! Good for you!" exclaimed my young mistress
delightedly. "Marry you, already? That would
be a step up for you, wouldn't it, Smith? From being
my maid to being a bank manager's wife! Something
like, that is. I always liked him&mdash;always thought him a
very nice, gentlemanly, superior sort of looking young
feller. And so did you, Miss Beat&mdash;so did you, Smith!
In the old days at Putney, with his garden-hose and all!
(Artful!) Well! Of course, it'll be a bit strange for
me at first, having to have somebody fresh to do for
me, after getting accustomed to you. But I've got
my clothes now; and I'm sort of used to things. I
shan't feel quite so lorst as I should at first. I shall
be sorry to say good-bye to you, o' course. You and
me have always hit it, Smith, some'ow, whether when
you was the maid&mdash;or I was," concluded my young
mistress simply, looking up at me with genuine affection
in her eyes. "And I shall always remember you, wherever
you are, and I hope you'll come round and have a
cup o' tea sometimes when you're Mrs. Brace, and I hope
you'll accept that two quarters' salary from me now
as a wedding present&mdash;not that I won't try and find
you some sort of a little resermenter when it comes to
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;350]</span>
The Day! How soon 'ull him and you be getting married,
do you suppose?"</p>

<p>She was at the end of this long and kind-hearted
speech before I could find breath to interrupt.</p>

<p>I said hastily: "Oh, but now you're making the same
mistake that I did about you! I may not have to leave
you at all, Miss Million. I don't know if I shall ever be
'Mrs. Brace.' I don't know if I've made up my mind
to marry him&mdash;I told him I must think it over&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Better 'ook him while you can, dear. Young men
are fearful ones for chopping and changing, once you
leave 'em to go off the coil, so ter speak," Miss Million
advised me in a friendly, motherly little tone. "Not
too much of your thinkin' it over. You're suited; well,
you tell him so!"</p>

<p>I said nothing. I didn't know what to say.</p>

<p>"Or," pursued Miss Million, "if you reely think
he's the sort to think more of you for 'keeping him
guessing,' as Hiram calls it, well, I tell you what. Me
and you'll go down to my country house&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Where?" I asked, astounded. I had forgotten Miss
Million's new plan of campaign. "Where will we go?"</p>

<p>"Why, to this Plass or Plarse, or whatever they
call it, in Wales, that I'm thinking of takin'," said
Miss Million, rustling the glossy leaves of the <i>Country
Life</i> with the advertisement that had taken her fancy.
"We'll go there, Smith, and chance the ducks. If the
perlice want us again&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She gave a little shiver.</p>

<p>"Well, they can come and fetch us from there, same
as they did from the 'Refuge.' Any'ow, we'll have a
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;351]</span>
bit of peace and quiet there first. I always did like the
idear of scenery, and there's lots of that there. And
we'll have down people to stay with us, so as to liven
things up a bit," enlarged Miss Million, wetting her
finger to turn over the pages of the magazine. "Vi
Vassity we'll have; must have her, after her bein' so
decent to us. A friend in need, that's what I call her.
And Mrs. Flukes&mdash;&mdash;" (This is the ventriloquist's
wife.)</p>

<p>"We'll have her," planned the future mistress of
the country house. "Give her a bit of a change, and
get her strength up again after that baby. We'll take
them down with us after we've been at the 'Refuge'
for a few days; and the nurse. And then we'll ask this
Mr. Brace of yours to come down, Smith, after a week
or so. Y'orter be able to give him word, one way or
another, after all that time, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I ought," I said.</p>

<p>"Well, there you are," said Miss Million complacently,
getting up from the couch. "I'll dress for late
dinner now. Did you think to have me cerise ironed
out a bit?"</p>

<p>"No; and I'm afraid it's too crushed for you to
wear," I said, with a great show of penitence. "I'm
afraid I shall have to dress you in the cream, instead."
She was ready dressed in the cream-coloured frock, with
the little golden shoes; she was just going down to join
her cousin in the big dining-room when she turned with
a last word to put in on Mr. Brace's account.</p>

<p>She said: "Your Auntie would be pleased about it
now."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;352]</span>
I said: "I don't suppose I shall hear anything more
about what my aunt would like me to do."</p>

<p>I was wrong.</p>

<p>For by this morning's post there has arrived a note
from my aunt at Putney. Not for me. For my mistress!</p>

<p>The note is short enough. It is signed only "Anastasia
Lovelace," and all it says is:</p>

<p class="blockquot1">"Enclosed find notes to the amount of thirty pounds,
being the sum advanced by you as salary to Miss Beatrice
Lovelace. She will now return to Putney, bringing
your receipt."</p>

<p>"Will," again. Will she?</p>

<p>And the notes!</p>

<p>Both Miss Million and I have been gazing in amazement
upon the rustling sheaf that my mistress took out
of the registered envelope.</p>

<p>Where, in the name of all that's unaccountable, did
Aunt Anastasia "raise" all that money, and in such
a short time?</p>

<p>When could she ever have put her hands upon thirty
pounds of English money?</p>

<p>Borrowed&mdash;pooh! Who has she to borrow from?</p>

<p>Beg&mdash;so like her!</p>

<p>Steal&mdash;I'm the only member of her family who's ever
been accused of that!</p>

<p>Surely&mdash;oh, surely, she can't have got the money
from the Honourable Jim?</p>

<p>I can't think how else she can have got it, though.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;353]</span>
There's only one thing I know.</p>

<p>I'm not going back to be Aunt Anastasia's niece any
more!</p>

<p>I'm going on being Miss Million's maid; I shall go
to this new place in Wales with her!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXII</h2>

<h3>WALES FOREVER!</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Well</span>, here we are again, as the clown says in the
harlequinade.</p>

<p>Once more the lives of Miss Million and her maid
have been set amidst scenes until now quite unfamiliar
to us.</p>

<p>After the noise and bustle of the Strand about the
hotel in July, the quiet, leafy depths of a remote Welsh
valley. After the glaring London sunshine on the baked
pavements, the soft Welsh rain that has been weeping
ever since our arrival over the wooded hills and the
tiny, stone-fenced fields, and the river that prattles over
its slaty bed and swirls into deep, clear pools a stone's-throw
below this furnished country house that Miss
Million has taken for three months.</p>

<p>At present the house party consists of Miss Million,
Miss Vi Vassity, Mrs. Flukes, the ventriloquist's
wife, her baby and her monthly nurse. Mr. Jessop,
who wrote all the business letters with regard
to the taking of the house, is to come down later, I
believe.</p>

<p>So is Mr. Reginald Brace.</p>

<p>In the meantime we have the place to ourselves, also
the staff left behind by the people of the house, consisting
of one fat cook, two housemaids who speak soft
Welsh-English, and a knives and boots boy who appears
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;355]</span>
to say nothing at all but "Ur?" meaning "I beg your
pardon?"</p>

<p>I, the lady's-maid, have meals with the staff in the
big, slate-floored kitchen.</p>

<p>This I insisted upon, just as I insisted upon travelling
third-class down from Euston, while my young
mistress "went first."</p>

<p>"We've simply got to behave more like real mistress
and maid, now that you've taken a country house
for the summer," I told her. "This isn't the
'Refuge'&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's nowhere so lively, if you ask me," said Miss
Million, looking disconsolately out of the dining-room
window. "Look at that view!"</p>

<p>The "view" shows a rain-soaked lawn, stretching
down to a tall rhododendron hedge, also dripping with
rain. Beneath the hedge is spread a dank carpet of
fallen pink blooms. Beyond the hedge is a brook that
was once a lane, leading down to a river that was once
a brook.</p>

<p>Beyond this come a flooded field and the highroad
that is a network of puddles. In the distance there
rises like a screen against the sky a tall hill, wooded
almost to the top, and set half-way up this hill we can
descry, faintly through the driving rain, a long white
house, with gables and a veranda overgrown with red
roses. And above all is a strip of grey sky, from
which the white rain falls noiselessly, ceaselessly.</p>

<p>"Here's a place!" says Miss Million disgustedly.
"Unless something happens to make it a bit different,
I shan't stay no three months, nor three weeks. It
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;356]</span>
fair gives me the pip, and I wish I was back in good
old London!"</p>

<p>"Cheer up. The rain may leave off one of these
days," I say, "or some of the people of the neighbourhood
may come to call."</p>

<p>This afternoon both my prognostications were fulfilled.</p>

<p>The rain did leave off, and the valley in which this
house is set became a green and smiling paradise,
scented with the fragrance of wet pine trees, and of
sweet peas and honeysuckle, and suddenly pregnant
with that other flavour which is new to me&mdash;part scent,
part sight, part sound. "The flavour of Wales"&mdash;some
quality quite indescribable; some wild native atmosphere
richer, sadder, sweeter, more "original" than
any that I had breathed in those flat, smiling garden
plots that are described as "rural England."</p>

<p>No wonder I've always heard that Welsh people who
have left their country suffer at times from such poignant
longings, such "hiræth" or home-sickness as is
unknown to the colonising, conquering Saxon!</p>

<p>Even Miss Million and Miss Vi Vassity are more inclined
to approve of the scenery now! And this afternoon
"the neighbourhood" called on the new tenant of
this place.</p>

<p>"The neighbourhood" seems to comprise any other
house within an afternoon's walk, or even motor-drive.</p>

<p>I heard the car drive up, from my attic bedroom,
and I flew down to the front door. For cook was baking,
and both of what she calls "them girls" had taken
their departure. It was the legitimate afternoon out
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;357]</span>
of Maggie-Mary, the first housemaid. And Blodwen,
the other, had asked special permission to attend a
funeral in the next valley.</p>

<p>I had said I would be housemaid in her place, so she
had sallied forth, all new black and gratified grins.</p>

<p>I found myself opening the door to three heterogeneous
parties of people at once, and ushering them
into the faded, pretty, pot-pourri-scented drawing-room.
It was empty. My mistress and her guests had
suddenly fled!</p>

<p>They&mdash;Miss Million, Vi Vassity, and Mrs. Flukes&mdash;had
betaken themselves into the bedroom that has been
given over to the baby's nursery, and were sitting over
the fire there gossiping with the young, mauve-clad
monthly nurse.</p>

<p>"Must I go down? Oh, what a nuisance; now
I'll have to change," began my mistress, but I was
firm.</p>

<p>"You'll go down in your garden tweeds and your
brown boots as you are," I said, "so as not to keep
the people waiting."</p>

<p>"What style of people are they? What do they
look like, dear?" put in Vi Vassity eagerly. She has
been strangling yawns all the morning, and I am sure
she was only too delighted at the idea of seeing a fresh
face. "Any nice boys with them?"</p>

<p>"No. No men at all&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never are, in the country. Yet people wonder nobody
takes any notice of being told to get back to the
land!" said London's Love, rising to her tiny kid-shod
feet, and refastening a suspender through the slit in
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;358]</span>
her skirt. "What are the women like? Country rectory?"</p>

<p>"Yes, one lot were," I reported. "The others that
came in the motor wore sort of very French hats and
feather boas, and look as if they never walked."</p>

<p>"Charity matinée," commented England's Premier
Comedienne, bustling to the door. "It's a shame not
to dress for 'em. I shan't be long, Nellie. You and
Ag go down first."</p>

<p>"How can I go down to the company until I've given
my little Basil his four o'clock feed?" protested the
ventriloquist's wife. She held out her arms for the
long white bundle of shawls that Olive, the young nurse,
lifted from the cradle set on two chairs in the corner
of the room. "Nellie'll have to make her entrance
alone."</p>

<p>And she did.</p>

<p>The confidence in herself that was first inspired by
the Honourable Jim has been greatly fostered by Mr.
Hiram P. Jessop. So I was not afraid that Miss Million
would be really overpoweringly shy, even on entering
a drawing-room full of strange callers.</p>

<p>I left her at the drawing-room door, and was
hastening kitchenwards again to bring out the tea when
the front-door bell rang once more. I opened it to two
very tall girls in Burberry mackintoshes.</p>

<p>They were both young; one had a long black plait
down her back. Both of them wore the same expression
of suppressed and gleeful, giggling excitement as I told
them that Miss Million was at home.</p>

<p>"Then, now for it!" breathed the flapper with the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;359]</span>
plait, in a gale of a whisper, as I took her mackintosh.
Both girls were in blue serge underneath, of a cut more
chastened than their arrogantly young voices. "I wonder
what on earth she's going to be like!"</p>

<p>"Alice! Do shut up!" muttered the elder girl angrily.
Then, turning to me: "Are there crowds of
other people here already?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Miss," I answered demurely. But I felt a
sudden warm sympathy with the two young things in
the hall. We had, I suspected, the same kind of voice,
the same carriage of the head, we had had the same
sort of clothes.</p>

<p>We'd been "raised," as Mr. Jessop puts it, with much
the same outlook. We had a class in common, the
class of the nouveaux-pauvres! Our eyes flashed understanding
as they met.</p>

<p>Then the younger girl exclaimed: "Wait a minute.
I <i>must</i> finish laughing before we go in!"</p>

<p>And she stood for a full minute, quivering and swaying
and rocking with perfectly silent mirth. Then she
pulled herself together and said gravely:</p>

<p>"Right. I've finished now. Say the Miss Owens,
please."</p>

<p>I rather wanted to have a good silent laugh to myself
as I solemnly announced the two girls.</p>

<p>They came, I afterwards gleaned, from the long
white house that faces us across the valley. Who the
other people were who were filling the chintz-covered
couch and easy-chairs in the drawing-room I didn't
gather.</p>

<p>I haven't "disentangled" the different hats and faces
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;360]</span>
and voices and costumes; I suppose I shall do so in
due course, and shall be able to give a clear description
of each one of these callers "from the neighbourhood"
upon Miss Million. I knew she would be an
object of curiosity to any neighbourhood to which she
came!</p>

<p>And I wonder how many of these people know that
she is one of the heroines of the Rattenheimer ruby case,
that hangs over our heads like a veritable sword of
Damocles the whole time!</p>

<p>But to get on to the principal excitement of the
afternoon&mdash;the utterly unlooked-for surprise that
awaited me in the kitchen!</p>

<p>The typically Welsh kitchen in this newly acquired
place of Miss Million's is to me the nicest room in the
house.</p>

<p>I love its spaciousness and its slate floor, and the
ponderous oak beams that bisect its smoke-blackened
ceiling and are hung with bunches of dried herbs and
with hams.</p>

<p>I love its dresser, full of willow-pattern china, and
its two big china dogs that face each other on the high
mantelpiece.</p>

<p>The row of bright brass candlesticks appeals to me,
and the grandfather's clock, with the sun, moon, and
stars on its face, and the smooth-scrubbed white
deal kitchen-table pitted with tiny worm-holes,
and the plants in the window, and everything about
it.</p>

<p>Miss Million declares she never saw such a kitchen
"in all her puff." Putney was inconvenient enough,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;361]</span>
the dear knows, but the Putney kitchen was a joke to
this one, where the kitchen range you can only describe
"as a fair scandal," and nothing else!</p>

<p>If she means to take the landlord's offer, later on,
and to take this place as it stands, she's going to have
everything pretty different.</p>

<p>I should be sorry if she did; I like the place to be
an utter anachronism in our utilitarian twentieth century,
just as it is. I don't mind the honeycomb of
draughts. I can put up with the soft, cave-like gloom
of it&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>It was this gloom that prevented me from seeing,
at first, that there was anybody in the kitchen but
cook, who was busily beating up batter for light cakes
in a big, yellow, white-lined bowl.</p>

<p>"Is the tea made?" I said.</p>

<p>It was not; the silver teapot, with the tea in it, was
being heated on the hob.</p>

<p>I moved to take up the singing kettle. It was then
that a tall man's form that had been sitting on a
settle on the other side of the fire rose and came towards
me.</p>

<p>The red glow of the fire through the bars shone on
the silver buttons and on the laurel-green cloth and on
the high boots of a chauffeur's livery. Of course! This
was the man who had driven over the people who had
come in the car.</p>

<p>But above the livery a voice spoke, a voice that I
knew, a voice that I could hardly believe was speaking to
me here.</p>

<p>"Allow me," said this softly inflected Irish voice.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;362]</span>
And the kettle was gently but firmly taken out of my
hand by the hand of&mdash;the Honourable James Burke.</p>

<p>I gave such a start of surprise that it is a mercy
I did not jolt against that kettle and send a stream
of scalding hot water over the laurel-green-cloth-clad
knees of the man before me.</p>

<p>And I said exactly what people always say in meloramas
when they are surprised at meeting anybody&mdash;thus
showing that melodrama is not always so utterly
unlike real life.</p>

<p>I cried "You!"</p>

<p>"Myself," announced the Honourable Jim, smiling
down at me as he deftly took the silver teapot from me
and filled first that and then the hot-water jug on
the tray that was already laid on the big table. "And
what is all this emotion at the sight of me? Is it too
much to hope that it's pleasure? Or is it just amazement?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I certainly never expected to s-see you," I spoke
falteringly in my great surprise, "or&mdash;or like this!"
I glanced at the gleam of the livery buttons. "May
I ask what in the world you are doing in those clothes?"</p>

<p>"Is it my livery you mean? Don't you think it's
rather neat?" suggested the Honourable Jim ingratiatingly.
"Don't you consider that it suits me almost
as well as the black gown and the apron and the doaty
little cap suit Miss Million's maid?"</p>

<p>"But&mdash;&mdash;" I gasped in amazement. "But why
are you wearing a chauffeur's livery?"</p>

<p>"Isn't the reason obvious? Because I've taken a
chauffeur's job."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;363]</span>
"You, Mr. Burke?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I, Miss Lovelace!" he laughed. "Is there
any reason you have to give against that, as you have
against every other mortal thing that the unfortunate
Jim Burke does?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;&mdash;Look here, I can't wait here talking," I told
him, for just at this minute I caught the surprised
glance of cook upon us both.</p>

<p>The spoon with which she beat up the batter was
poised in mid-air as she listened to everything that this
superior-looking lady's-maid and still more superior-looking
chauffeur had to say to each other. "I must
take the tea into the drawing-room."</p>

<p>He opened the kitchen door for me as I hastened
away with the tray.</p>

<p>Gentleman-adventurer, bronco-buster, stoker, young
gentleman of leisure, chauffeur! What next will be the
rôle that the Honourable and Extraordinary Jim will
take it into his head to play?</p>

<p>Chauffeur, of all things! Why chauffeur?</p>

<p>My head was still buzzing with the surprise of it
all, when I heard the other buzz&mdash;the shrill, insistent,
worrying buzz that is made by women's voices when a
lot of them are gathered together in a strange house,
and are all talking at once; "made" talk, small talk,
weather talk, the talk that is&mdash;as Miss Vassity, for
instance, would put it&mdash;"enough to drive any one to
drink."</p>

<p>In the drawing-room where these callers were grouped
I just caught a scrap here and a scrap there as I moved
about with the tea-things. This sort of thing:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;364]</span>
"And what do you think of this part of the country,
Miss Million? Are you intending to make a long
stay&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She seemed such a nice girl! Came to me with
such a good character from her&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never touch it. It doesn't suit me. In coffee
I like just a very little, and my daughter's the same.
But my husband"&mdash;(impressively)&mdash;"my husband is
just the reverse. He won't touch it in coff&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>&mdash;"hope you intend to patronise our little Sale of
Work, Miss Million, on the twenty-sixth? Oh, you
must all come. And I'm still asking everybody for
contributions to my&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do shut up, Alice!" (fierce whisper from the
young girl in navy-blue).</p>

<p>"Now we've got this new chauffeur we may hope
for a little peace!" This languidly, from the lady in
the uncountrified-looking hat. She, I suppose, is the
Honourable Jim's employer. "Quite an efficient man,
as far as one can judge, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Quite right, quite right. Far too many trees about
the place. I like a good view. Plenty of space around
a house.... Of course, you've only ten bedrooms here,
Miss Million; ah, eleven? quite right. But at home....
Of course, I had a most lovely home in the&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Wearisome gabble! I thought.</p>

<p>I caught an ineffable grimace on Miss Million's small,
shrewd face behind the silver teapot. I bent down to
add hot water to it. Under cover of my ministrations
she murmured: "You see, I don't have to bust myself
talkin' polite to this lot; nothing'll stop 'em. I say!
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;365]</span>
Does that cook know enough to give a nice cup o' tea
to the shaveer of her that came in the car, Smith?"</p>

<p>"I think the chauffeur knows enough to get one!"
I murmured dryly. "Or anything else he&mdash;&mdash;" Here
I found I was the only person in the room who was
talking.</p>

<p>A suddenly deathly silence had fallen upon the roomful
of talking women, who all knew each other, even if
they had never met their little hostess before. Something
had "stopped 'em." The chatter and buzz of
small talk left off with a click.</p>

<p>And that quite definite "click" was the opening of
the drawing-room door upon an apparition such as none
of them, I am certain, had ever seen in a drawing-room
before.</p>

<p>Its brightly fair hair seemed to have "sprouted"
not so much a hat as a grotesque halo of black, long,
feathery wisps that surrounded a face with black
eyes and a complexion "made-up" to be dazzlingly
pink.</p>

<p>Its transparent corsage gave glimpses of fair and
sumptuous shoulders and of much lingerie ribbon.</p>

<p>The frock was layer upon layer of folded ninon in
different yellows, shading down from bright lemon yellows
through chrome yellow and mustard colour to a
kind of marigold tint at the hem, under which appeared
scarlet silk stockings and tall, gilt boots with heels
so high that the wearer was practically walking on
her toes, à la Genée, as she made her startling entrance.</p>

<p>It was, of course, Miss Vi Vassity, in one of her most
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;366]</span>
successful stage get-ups; the frock in which she sings
her topical song&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquotc">"They've been there a long time now!"</p>

<p>with the usual verses about courting couples, and the
Gorgonzola, and the present Government.</p>

<p>And she beamed round upon this gathering of natives
of a quiet country neighbourhood with the same dazzling,
prominent-toothed smile as she flashes from her
friends in the front row of the stalls to her equally devoted
gallery boys.</p>

<p>"No need for introductions, eh?" uttered London's
Love, lightly, to the petrified-looking assembly.</p>

<p>I felt that I would have sacrificed another quarter's
salary rather than have missed the look on the face of
the acidulated lady who came in the car as Miss Vi
Vassity perched herself lightly on the arm of the couch
where she was sitting, and called to Nellie for the love
of anything to give her a nice cup of tea.</p>

<p>"Does one good to see a few faces around me once
again!" prattled on the artiste, while the two girls from
the other side of the valley leant forward and devoured
every detail of her appearance with gluttonous
brown eyes.</p>

<p>Pure ecstasy was painted all over the plain ironic
face of the tall girl with the thick black plait. I saw
from the look of the hussy that she was "taking in"
everything to reproduce it at home, in that white house
on the hill. And presently there was plenty to reproduce.</p>

<p>For one of the rectoryish-looking party plucked up
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;367]</span>
courage to ask Miss Vassity "what she thought of this
place."</p>

<p>That opened the floodgates!</p>

<p>Perched on the arm of the couch, England's Premier
Comedienne proceeded to "hold the house" with her
views on this mansion and its furniture.</p>

<p>"Not what I'd call a lively spot; still, there's always
the pheasant and her little 'uns walking about on the
lawn at three G.M., if you're fond of geology, and
the rabbit on the tennis-court at eight o'clock sharp.
That's about all the outdoor entertainment in this
place," she rattled on.</p>

<p>"Indoors, of course, is a fair museum of curiosities.
Continuous performance, eh, Nellie? The oil-lamps
everywhere, with the collection of midges on all the
bowls; those are very fine.</p>

<p>"Couldn't beat those at the Tower of London! And
the back kitchen, with the water from the stand-pipe
outside overflowing into the middle of the floor. Talk
about Glimpses into the Middle Ages!</p>

<p>"What takes my fancy is the girls clinkin' to and
from the scullery in those pattens they wear. Makes
the floor look like nothing on earth but a bar-counter
where glasses have been set down, doesn't it?"&mdash;this to
the rector's wife.</p>

<p>"And the paint, too. And the wall-papers. Oo-er!
And all the window-cords broken," enlarged the beaming
apparition in all-yellow, whose personality invaded
the room like a burst of brilliant sunshine through a
thunder-cloud.</p>

<p>"Not to mention all the doors having to be propped
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;368]</span>
open! No complete set of china anywhere. Wedges
bitten out of every&mdash;er&mdash;blessed egg-cup! Pick up a
bit of real Dresden, and the seccotined piece comes off
in your hand.</p>

<p>"As for the furniture, well, half of it looks as if
it had bin used for Harry Tate to play about with in
a screaming new absurdity, entitled 'Moving,' or
'Spring-cleaning,' or something like&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here the acidulated voice of the lady who'd come
in the motor broke in with some very rebukeful remark.
Something to the effect that she had always considered
everything so delightful that the dear Price-Vaughans
had in the house&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Pr'aps the dear What-Price-Vaughans," retorted
the comedienne, "can get along with their delightful
style of bathroom?"</p>

<p>"Oh, do tell us," implored the girl with the black
plait, "what's the matter with that?"</p>

<p>"The bath, Kiddy? Absolutely imposs!" decreed
London's Love. "Water comes in at the rate of a
South-Eastern Dead-Stop. Turn one tap on and you
turn the other off. Not to speak of there only being
one bath, and that five sizes too small, dear. The Not-at-Any-Price-Vaughans
must be greyhound built for
slimness, if you ask me. It don't seem to fit our shrinking
Violet, as you can imagine. Why, look at her!"</p>

<p>Quite an unnecessary request, as the fascinated, horrified
eyes of the whole party had not yet left her sumptuous
and bedizened person.</p>

<p>"Call it a bath?" she concluded, with her largest
and most unabashedly vulgar wink. "I'd call it a&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;369]</span>
We weren't privileged to hear what she could call
it, for at this moment the lady with the very towny
hat rose with remarkable suddenness, and asked in a
concise and carrying voice that her man might be told
to bring round Miss Davis's car.</p>

<p>I slipped out to the kitchen and to Miss Davis's man,
who, as I expected, had finished an excellent tea and
the subjugation of cook at the same time.</p>

<p>"Your mistress would like the car round at once,
please," I said, with a frantic effort not to smile as I
caught the mischievous, black-framed, blue eyes of the
Honourable Jim Burke.</p>

<p>He rose. "Good afternoon, ma'am, and thank you
for one of the most splendid teas I've ever had in my
life," he said in that flattering voice of his to cook, as
she bustled out, beaming upon him as she went into the
scullery.</p>

<p>"Good afternoon, Miss Smith"&mdash;to me. "You've
never shaken hands with me yet. But I suppose this
is scarcely the moment to remind you, when I've taken
on a job several pegs below what I was when I saw
you last&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Of course, at that I had to give him my hand. I
said: "But why are you Miss Davis's chauffeur?"</p>

<p>"Because I couldn't get a job with Miss Million,"
he told me simply. "She hasn't got a car of her own
yet. Not that she'd have me, in any case&mdash;a man she'd
found out deceiving her about her own relatives!"</p>

<p>"But why 'the job,' anyhow?"</p>

<p>"I must earn my living&mdash;honestly if possible," said
the Honourable Jim with his wickedest twinkle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;370]</span>
"Also I'd made up my mind a little change of air in
Wales would do me good just now, and I'd no friends
who happened to be coming to these parts. It was
these parts I'd set my heart on.</p>

<p>"The mountain scenery! Can you beat it? And
when I saw the advertisement of that old trout upstairs
there&mdash;I mean that elegant maiden lady with private
means and a nice house and a car of her own&mdash;I jumped
at answering it. The country round about is so romantic.
That drew me, Miss Lovelace.... Well, I
suppose I must be tooting her home."</p>

<p>He turned to the back entrance.</p>

<p>Then he turned to me once more and launched his
most audacious bit of nonsense yet.</p>

<p>He said, softly laughing: "Ah! You know well
enough why I'm here. It's to be near you, child."</p>

<p>What a good thing it is that I know exactly how to
take this laughing, blarneying, incorrigible Irishman!
What a blessing that I am not as poor little Miss Million
was, who was utterly taken in by any blatantly
insincere compliment that this young&mdash;well, I can
say no worse than "this young Celt" chose to toss
off!</p>

<p>So I just said lightly, "Too flattered!" and hurried
away to hand the callers their wraps and umbrellas
in the hall.</p>

<p>I'm glad I was in time to witness another rather
priceless scene.</p>

<p>Namely, the entrance of Miss Vi Vassity into the
hall with the other ladies, and her recognition of the
big young man in the laurel-green livery, with the handsome
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;371]</span>
face so stolidly set under the peaked chauffeur's
cap.</p>

<p>"Jim!" exclaimed the comedienne, in a piercing
treble. "Well, whatever next? If it isn't my pal
Jim Burke!"</p>

<p>"Just the sort of person one would expect her to
have for a 'pal,' as she calls it," came in a not-too-soft
aside from the owner of the car, then, haughtily,
"Home, Burke."</p>

<p>"Yes, Miss," said the new chauffeur, as respectfully
as I could have said it myself, and he touched his peaked
cap to his mistress with a kind of side-effect of "Cheery
O, Vi," to the brilliant figure standing gasping with
astonishment upon the top step.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII</h2>

<h3>MISS MILLION HAS AN IDEA!</h3>

<p class="noindent">"<span class="smcap">Whatever</span> in the wide world is young Jim up to
now!" exclaimed London's Love, when at last the heavy
hall door was closed upon the motoring ladies, the rectory
party, and the two girls from across the valley.</p>

<p>Miss Million's face was rather more serious than
usual.</p>

<p>"'Ere! I have an idea about that, Vi," she said.
"And you, Smith, listen. It's just occurred to me."
She glanced about the darkened hall with the stags'
heads and the suit of armour.</p>

<p>"You know I shall never be able to trust that Mr.
Burke again. He let me down. Now what if he's lettin'
all of us down?</p>

<p>"F'rinstance, a young man like that, with heaps of
friends with plenty of money, and always able to do as
he likes up to now, what's he mean by suddenly taking
on a situation as a common shoveer?"</p>

<p>"Ar!" responded England's Premier Comedienne,
who has often made the stalls rock with laughter over
the concentrated meaning which she can infuse into that
one monosyllable long-drawn-out.</p>

<p>"Ar!" She turned upon me the wink that delights
the gallery, then said dryly: "What's <i>your</i> idea, Nellie?"</p>

<p>"Why, I believe he's no more nor less than a common
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;373]</span>
robber and burglar! A sort of Raffles, like in that
play," declared Miss Million in a soft, excited whisper.</p>

<p>"'Twouldn't surprise me a bit if he'd disguised himself
like that, and gone into service with that frosty-face,
stuck-up Miss Davis that was calling just because
he wanted to get his footing in a wealthy house where
there was heaps of valuables, and cetrer.</p>

<p>"Here's this Miss Davis got more than a bit of her
own, evident! And did you notice the string o' pearls?
She'll have more of those sort of things at home, I bet
you," said Million, adding with impressive hoarseness,
"I believe that's what he's after. Jewels!!"</p>

<p>"What? Jim?" Miss Vi Vassity gave a slow, enjoying
laugh. "Him? Likerly!"</p>

<p>"Ah, he's got round you, Vi. I believe you've got
a soft corner for him in your heart still, however much
of a rotter the man is, but I'm off, dead off.</p>

<p>"More than that, it wouldn't surprise me," continued
my mistress, still in her impressive tone, "if I'm not far
off guessing who took the Rattenheimer ruby that me
and Smith's in this fix about!"</p>

<p>"Ah, go on!" said Miss Vi Vassity, striking a match
for her cigarette against the minnow-shaped sole of her
gilt boot. "Are you goin' to go and believe that my
pal Jim sneaked that and then saw you and her in trouble
for it? Do you believe that, Smithie?"</p>

<p>"I don't," I said, without hesitation.</p>

<p>Miss Million said defiantly: "Think it over! Think
it over! He was always in and out of the hotel, was
that Mr. Burke. He was hobnobbing with the Rattenheimers
and one and another all day long.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;374]</span>
"And he wanted the money. We've proof of that!
And he's none too particular about how he gets it!
Why, you yourself, Vi. You know he owes you pounds
and pounds and pounds at this minute that he's 'borrowed,'
and goodness knows how he intends to pay you
back!</p>

<p>"You know he's got the cheek of the Old Gentleman
himself! And," concluded my young mistress, with a
look of shrewdness on her face that I imagine must
have been inherited from the late Mr. Samuel Million,
"if he isn't the one who stole the ruby, <span class="smcap">who is</span>?"</p>

<p>A violent ring at the hall-door bell made the finish
to this peroration.</p>

<p>I opened the door to a small, freckle-faced telegraph
boy.</p>

<p>"For Miss Smith," he said in the pretty, up-and-down
Welsh accent that is such a rest after Cockney.
I took the wire. I wondered if it was Aunt Anastasia
again.</p>

<p>It wasn't.</p>

<p>It was something very much more exciting. The
wire was signed "Reginald Brace," and it said: "I am
coming down by the nine o'clock train to-night. Jewel
mystery cleared up."</p>

<p>Oh, how can it have been cleared up? What is the
solution of the mystery? To think that at least four
and a half hours must elapse before we know!</p>

<p>Really, I do think Mr. Reginald Brace might have
had pity on our burning curiosity and anxiety! I do
think he might have given some hint, in this wire of
his, as to who did really steal that wretched ruby!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;375]</span>
"Well, s'long as it's all cleared up that it wasn't
us that done it, that ought to be comfort enough to
us," said my mistress philosophically, as I was fastening
her into the blush-pink tea-gown for dinner. We've
put dinner on an hour late since our visitor is coming
down so late.</p>

<p>"Though, mark my words, Smith," she continued,
"it wouldn't surprise me one bit if that young gentleman
of yours from the bank brought down that mute-of-a-funeral
from Scotland Yard to tell Miss Davis's
new shoveer that <i>he</i> was wanted by the police this time!"</p>

<p>"We'll see," I said, smiling.</p>

<p>For the Honourable Jim's faults may be as thick
and as black as the hairs of the Honourable Jim's head.
But of this other thing I feel he could not be capable.</p>

<p>"It used to be me that thought you was too hard
on that Mr. Burke, Smith. Now here you are turning
round and won't hear a word against the man,"
said my mistress, half laughing. "You're as pigheaded
as Vi about it! And, talking about Vi, here's
this packet of golden hairpins she's left in here; she
was lookin' all over for them this afternoon. Better
take them in to her now."</p>

<p>It was on this errand that I entered the spare room
that has been assigned to London's Love.</p>

<p>She was sitting in a cerulean-blue dressing-jacket
in front of the looking-glass, drawing a tiny brush,
charged with lamp-black, across her eyelashes, and
using "language," as she calls it, over the absence of
electric lights by which to dress.</p>

<p>"I shall look a perfect sketch at dinner, see if I
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;376]</span>
don't. Not that it matters a twopenny dash, me not
being the bill-topper in any sense in this revue," said
England's Premier Comedienne cheerily. "It's the
pretty little lady's-maid's charming scena with the
young bank manager. Tell me, Smithie&mdash;&mdash;" Here
she turned abruptly round and looked at me sharply.
"Been thinking over his proposal, have you? Going
to take him, are you?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;er&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;er&mdash;shouldn't if I was you!"</p>

<p>"You wouldn't?" I said interestedly. "Why not?"</p>

<p>London's Love put down the make-up brush and
scanned her own appearance in the glass. Then she
got up as if to fetch a frock out of the wardrobe. But
she paused, put a small, highly manicured but capable-looking
hand on each of my shoulders, and said, holding
me so: "You don't like him, Kiddy."</p>

<p>"Oh! But I do! So much!" I protested. "I
think Mr. Brace is everything nice ... I think he
would make such a splendid husband! He's so steady,
and honourable, and sterling, and straight, and kind,
and simple-minded, and reliable, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah! Poppycock!" cried the comedienne, with her
loud, indulgent laugh. "You're just stringing off a list
of aggravating things that a girl might put up with in
a man if&mdash;if, mind you!&mdash;she was head over ears in
love with him as well. But, great Pip! Fancy marrying
a man for those things!</p>

<p>"Why, what d'you suppose it would be like? I
ought to know," she answered herself before I, rather
surprised, could say anything. "One of those 'sterling'
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;377]</span>
young men that never gave his mother an hour's anxiety;
one of those reliable, simple-minded fellers that you
always knew what he was goin' to say an' do next;
always came home to tea on the dot, and 'never cared
to wander from his own fireside'&mdash;that's what I was
talked into marryin' by my aunts when I was a kid of
eighteen," said Miss Vi Vassity quite bitterly.</p>

<p>"Oh, were you?" I cried, astonished. "I never
knew&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, that was my first husband. Answered to the
name of Bert&mdash;Albert. Very good position in the
waterworks in our town at home," said London's Love.</p>

<p>"A real good husband he was. Lor', how he did
used to aggravate me! It's a good many years ago,
Smithie, and I've almost forgotten what he looked like.
I can just call to mind the way he used to snuffle when
he had a cold in the head; shocking colds he used to
catch, but he would always get up and light the kitchen
fire to get me an early cup o' tea, no matter what
the weather was. That I will say for him. The man
I remember, though&mdash;he was pretty different!"</p>

<p>There was a silence in the countrified-looking bedroom
that the music-hall artiste had filled with the atmosphere
of a theatrical dressing-room. Then England's
Premier Comedienne went on in a softer, more
diffident voice than I had ever heard from her.</p>

<p>"He was the young man that jilted Vi Vassity a
good deal later on. A trick cyclist he was.... Small,
but beautifully built fellow, supple as a cat. Bad-tempered
as a cat, too! And shifty, and mean in little
ways! A cruel little devil, too, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;378]</span>
She sighed.</p>

<p>"I fair doted on him!" concluded the Star simply.
"Much I cared what sort of a rotter he was! It's
the way a woman's got to feel about a man once in a
lifetime. If she doesn't, she's been done out of the best
that's going."</p>

<p>"But," I suggested, "she misses a good deal of
pain?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and of everything else. Nothing else is worth
it, Smithie. You can't understand what it was to me
just the way his hair grew," said the comedienne who'd
loved the trick cyclist. "Cropped close, of course, and
black. Looked as if a handful of soot had been rubbed
over his head. But soft as velvet to your lips. I used
to tell him that. Never a one for talking much himself.
He'd a trick of speaking almost as if he grudged you
the words; curious, and shy, and my word! wasn't it
fascinatin'? Then he'd give a little laugh in the middle
of a sentence sometimes. That used to go to my heart,
straight as a pebble into a pool. Yes, and it'd stay
there, with the ripple stirring above it. Anybody
would have loved his voice....</p>

<p>"But! Bless my soul alive!" she broke off into her
loud, jovial, everyday tone again. "About time I left
off maunderin' about when&mdash;other&mdash;lips, and threw
some glad-rags on to me natural history! I'll wear the
marmalade-coloured affair with the dangles.... Well!
'Marry the man you fancy,' as it says in the song, and
don't let me go puttin' you off any of 'em, Miss
Smith&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But whether the Star did "put me off" by her reminiscences
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;379]</span>
of her trick cyclist with the charming, reluctant
voice, or whether it is that I've slowly been
coming round to the conclusion subconsciously in my
own mind, I find that, however estimable he may be,
I shall never be able to marry Mr. Reginald Brace.</p>

<p>No! Not if I have to go on being Miss Million's
or somebody else's lady's-maid until I'm old and grey.</p>

<p>I somehow realised that with the first moment that
I opened the door to the tall, mackintoshed figure&mdash;it
was raining again, of course, outside&mdash;Miss Million,
very pretty and flushed and eager in her rose-pink tea-gown,
followed close upon my heels as I let Mr. Brace
in, and behind her came Miss Vi Vassity, sumptuous in
the orange satin that she calls "the marmalade-coloured
affair."</p>

<p>And all three of us, without even bidding the young
bank manager "Good evening," chorused together:
"Tell us, for goodness' sake, tell us at once! Who did
steal the Rattenheimer ruby?"</p>

<p>"Nobody!" replied Mr. Reginald Brace, in his
pleasant but rather precise voice, and with his steady
grey eyes fixed on me as I, in my inevitable cap and
apron, waited to take his coat.</p>

<p>We all gasped "Nobody? What&mdash;&mdash;Why&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The Rattenheimer ruby has not been stolen at all,"
replied Mr. Reginald Brace, smiling encouragingly
upon us.</p>

<p>And then, while we all gaped and gazed upon him,
and kept the poor wretched man waiting for his dinner,
he went on to tell us the full history of the celebrated
ruby.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;380]</span>
It appears that an exquisite paste copy has been
made of the priceless pendant, which the German-Jewish
owners have kept by them to delude possible jewel
thieves.</p>

<p>And now it is they themselves who have been deluded
by the same wonderful replica of the celebrated gem!</p>

<p>For Mrs. Rattenheimer, it appears, imagined that it
was the replica that reposed in her jewel-case, from
which the original was missing after that fatal ten minutes
of carelessness during which she left that jewel-case
and her bedroom door at the Cecil unlocked.</p>

<p>But upon sending that replica to the experts to supplement
the description of the missing ruby, she was
told that an absurd mistake had been made. This,
the supposed "copy," was none other than the celebrated
ruby itself!</p>

<p>"And she didn't know her own property?" Vi Vassity's
loud, cheerful voice resounded through the hall.
"Why, the old girl will be the laughing-stock of London!"</p>

<p>"Yes. I think Mrs. Rattenheimer realises that herself,"
said Mr. Reginald Brace. "That is why she
and her husband now intend to hush the matter up
as much as possible; they do not mean to prosecute
inquiries as to who took the replica."</p>

<p>"Don't they think we done that, then?" asked Miss
Million loudly.</p>

<p>"They are dropping all inquiries," said Mr. Brace.</p>

<p>"Then I've a good mind to sue 'em for libel for the
inquiries they made already," said Million heatedly.
"I shall consult my&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;381]</span>
Here there was another ring at the bell.</p>

<p>"Talk of angels!" exclaimed my young mistress, as
I opened the door to a second masculine figure in a
dripping rain-coat, "why here he is, just the very person
I was going to pass the remark about! It's my
cousin Hiram!" And it was that young American who
strode into the feeble light of the oil-lamps in the
hall.</p>

<p>"I guess I must have been just a few yards behind
you before I took the wrong turning to these antediluvian
river-courses that they call roads," said
Mr. Hiram P. Jessop to Mr. Brace, while he held
Million's little hand with great tenderness. "Good
evening, Cousin Nellie and everybody. If I may shed
this damp macintaw, I've a few pieces of startling
news&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"For the sake of Lloyd George himself, come into
the dinin'-room and let's have 'em while we're feeding,"
suggested Miss Vassity.</p>

<p>She grabbed an arm of each young man, and ran
them into the room to the right that always smells of
country churches.</p>

<p>"Part of the news concerns Miss Smith," added Mr.
Jessop, over the upholstery of his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Then in the name of the Insurance Act let's all sit
down together and hear it. Not so much nonsense
about 'the maid.' We'll pretend we're at the 'Refuge,'
and stretch for ourselves," decreed Vi Vassity, positively
pushing me, in my cap and apron, down into the
dining-room chair next to Mr. Reginald Brace in his
correct tweeds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;382]</span>
"Now! One mouthful of tomato soup, and out with
it&mdash;the news, I mean."</p>

<p>"To begin with, I guess they've found the jewel
thief," announced Mr. Hiram P. Jessop. "That is,
she's owned up. So real disgusted, I guess, to find she
hadn't secured the genu-ine ruby.</p>

<p>"I've come straight on from Rats himself, who gave
me the whole story. She brought round the other one
with her own hands, and said she'd taken it for a bet.
She always was eccentric.</p>

<p>"Well, I calculate you've got to believe a lady of
title," concluded the young American between two
spoonfuls of soup. "If you can't rely upon your
old aristocracy to tell the truth in this country, who
can you rely on?"</p>

<p>"Better ask the Honourable Jim!" laughed Miss Vi
Vassity. "And now tell us who's the lady."</p>

<p>"Another acquaintance of yours, Miss Vassity," announced
Mr. Jessop, giving the title with an air.
"Lady Haye-Golightly!"</p>

<p>Another little buzz of comment greeted the name
of the lady whom I had always called "the cobra-woman."</p>

<p>And then Mr. Jessop turned from this surprising
theme to something that seemed nearer still to his heart.
"Well, and, Cousin Nellie, here's a bit of good news.
I guess that bomb-dropper of mine is a cinch. Your
authorities over here are taking it up all right. They're
going to use it all right!"</p>

<p>"Oh, are they, Hiram?" said my young mistress in
the indulgent tone of a grown-up person discussing its
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;383]</span>
toys with some child. She always adopts this tone
towards her cousin's invention. "And what do they
think they're goin' to use it for, eh?"</p>

<p>The young American looked round the table at each
of the faces turned towards him.</p>

<p>Then, in a detached tone, he made the announcement
of that which was to make all the difference in the world
to all of us.</p>

<p>"I guess they'll use it&mdash;in this coming war!"</p>

<p>Well, of course we'd seen "rumours of wars" in the
day-old papers that had reached us in our wet Welsh
valley. But a houseful of women recks little of newspaper
news&mdash;or did reck little. It all seemed as far
away, as little to do with us as, say, the report of some
railway accident in Northern China!</p>

<p>Now the young inventor's simple words brought it
home to us!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV</h2>

<h3>THE FORTUNES OF WAR</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">War</span>&mdash;European war was at our very doors, and it
seemed more than likely that England was going to
join in, Mr. Jessop said.</p>

<p>He went on, quite quietly, to inform us that it would
find him ready, he guessed. He'd sent in his application
early to the Royal Flying Corps, and he guessed
that next time we saw him he'd be an Army aviator all
right, in training for using his own bomb-dropper&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Here his young cousin dropped her soup-spoon with
a clatter.</p>

<p>"What?" cried Miss Million sharply. "You? If
there is any war, shall you start fighting the Germans?"</p>

<p>"I should say so!" smiled Mr. Hiram P. Jessop.
"Why, yes!"</p>

<p>"But you're American! Why ever on earth should
you fight?" demanded Miss Million rather shrilly.
"Nothing to do with you! You aren't English; you
aren't Belgium! You belong to a&mdash;what's it?&mdash;a neutral
nation!"</p>

<p>"I guess I'm not going to let that stand in my way
any," said Mr. Hiram P. Jessop, "if there's a chance
of getting in at those hounds!"</p>

<p>And I saw a curious change come over my mistress's
small, bonny face as she regarded this man who&mdash;under
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;385]</span>
no obligation to fight&mdash;felt he could not merely look on
at a struggle between Right and Might.</p>

<p>It was not the sentimental, girlish adoration that she
had turned upon her first fancy, the Honourable Jim.</p>

<p>It was the look of a real woman upon the man who
pleases her.</p>

<p>This was not the only quick change which the war
made.</p>

<p>For instance, who would have thought that those
German Jews, the Rattenheimers, would ever have had
to be interned in a camp in the middle of England,
away from all their friends and all their jewel-collecting
pursuits?</p>

<p>And who would have thought that Mr. Hiram P.
Jessop&mdash;I beg his pardon! I mean Flight-Lieutenant
H. P. Jessop, of the Royal Flying Corps, was responsible
for the prompt and uncompromising manner
in which that alien couple were "dropped upon" by the
authorities. Well! I should like to hope that their imprisonment
was at least half as uncomfortable as that
night which my mistress and I passed&mdash;thanks to them&mdash;at
Vine Street police-station! But no, I suppose
that's too much to expect.</p>

<p>Then there's the change that has been brought about
by the war in my young mistress herself.</p>

<p>At a time when all uniform is glorious, she herself
has gone back to uniform, to her old, cast-aside livery
of the print frock, the small white cap, the apron of
domestic service!</p>

<p>I gasped when I first heard what she intended to
take up, namely, the position of "ward-maid" in a big
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;386]</span>
London house that has been turned into a hospital for
wounded officers.</p>

<p>"I must do something for them," she told me. "I
feel I must!"</p>

<p>"Well, but why this particular thing?" I demurred.
"If you wanted to you could take up nursing&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nursin', nothing!" she retorted, in an idiom which
she had borrowed from the Flight-Lieutenant. "To
begin with, I've no gift that way. I know I haven't;
a girl can feel that in her bones. Secondly, I ain't no
training for it. I'm not one of these that imagine because
it goes to their heart to see a pore fellow with
a bandage round his head, well, they're a born nurse!"</p>

<p>"With your money," I told her, "you could provide
that hospital with any number of indoor maids to do
the work!"</p>

<p>"Yes. And how'd they do it? Not as I should,"
maintained the Soldier's-Orphanage-trained girl very
proudly. "I know the ways o' some o' these townified
maids; haven't I watched 'em all down Laburnum
Grove? I'm going to make my 'bit' another way!"</p>

<p>From morn until dewy eve the girl who was once
Miss Million, the heiress, works harder than ever she
worked when she was my Aunt Anastasia's maid-of-all-work.
Thursday is her afternoon off; Thursday sees
her motoring in the Park, exquisitely got up in a frock
and furs that were bought during the "shopping orgy"
of the first week of her wealth. And&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>She has thought it over once again, and she has
promised to marry her aviator on his very first leave.</p>

<p>"Seemed to make all the difference, him being a
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;387]</span>
soldier; seems to make anybody just twice the man they
was before. And him just three times, seeing he'd no
real call to go and fight, only he wanted to!" she admitted
to me, when we were all packing up to come away
from the house in Wales, where we had left the ventriloquist's
wife in charge.</p>

<p>So that, if all's well, I shall yet have the task of attiring
Miss Nellie Million in her shimmering bridal-gown
and her filmy veil for that wedding of hers on which I
had set my heart from the beginning.</p>

<p>Only&mdash;her bridesmaids will have to be Marmora, the
Breathing Statue Girl, and the lively little Boy-Impersonator.</p>

<p>Vi Vassity and I will be debarred from that function,
because we're both married women.</p>

<p>Yes! I am married, too!</p>

<p>But not to Mr. Reginald Brace.</p>

<p>For when he persisted, "Why are you so sure you
could never care?"</p>

<p>I said frankly, "I hate to hurt you. But&mdash;Reginald,
I don't like the way your hair grows."</p>

<p>He looked at me in utter bewilderment through the
darkness-made-visible of those Welsh lamps.</p>

<p>He said: "But a man can't help the way his hair
grows!"</p>

<p>"No. And a woman can't help the way she feels
about it," I told him sadly but resolutely.</p>

<p>He saw at last that I meant I wasn't going to take
him. He went&mdash;after saying all those things about remembering
me as the sweetest girl he'd ever met, and
if ever I wanted a friend, et cetera&mdash;all the pathetic,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;388]</span>
well-meant, useless things that I suppose a rejected man
finds some comfort in.</p>

<p>He went back to a whirl of business at his bank, and
he has stayed there ever since, "carrying on" his usual
everyday job (the only sort of "carrying on" he
knows, as Vi Vassity would say). In his way he is "on
active service" too; doing his duty by his country.
There is something the matter with his heart&mdash;besides
his crossed-in-love affair, I mean&mdash;something that prevents
him from enlisting. Very hard lines on him, to
be quite young and otherwise fit, but doomed to remain
a civilian. Of course there have to be some people
as civilians still. We couldn't get on without any
civilians at all, could we?</p>

<p>My lover joined as a trooper the day before war was
officially declared.</p>

<p>And he came over to Miss Million's house in Wales
to tell us of his plans the morning after Mr. Brace had
gone off to town. He&mdash;the other man&mdash;was still in the
laurel-green chauffeur's kit that he was so soon going
to change for his Majesty's drab-coloured but glorious
livery. And I was in my maid's black, with cap and
apron, when I opened the door to him.</p>

<p>"Where's your mistress? In the drawing-room?
Then come into the library, child," said the Honourable
Jim Burke, "for it's you I've come to call
upon."</p>

<p>"I've only a minute to spare you," I said forbiddingly,
as I showed him into the square, rather mouldy-smelling
library, with its wall of unread books and its
family-portraits of dead and gone Price-Vaughans.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;389]</span>
"And besides, I don't think a chauffeur ought to come
to the front door and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I shall not be a chauffeur a minute longer than
it takes me to get out of this dashed kit," said the Honourable
Jim. Then he told me about his enlisting for
active service.</p>

<p>"It won't be much time I shall have before that
regiment gets its orders," he said. "Time enough,
though&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused and looked hard at me. So hard that I
felt myself colouring, and turned away.</p>

<p>He took a step after me. I felt him give a little pull
at my apron-strings to make me look round.</p>

<p>"Time enough to get married, darling of my heart,"
said Jim Burke, laughing softly.</p>

<p>And he took me into his arms and kissed me; at first
very gently, then eagerly, fiercely, as if to make up for
time already lost and for all that time yet to come when
we must be apart from each other.</p>

<p>This, if you please, was all the proposal that ever I
had from the young man.</p>

<p>I know all his faults.</p>

<p>Unscrupulous; he doesn't care how many duller
and stodgier people he uses to his own advantage.
Insincere; except to his wife. To me he shows his
heart!</p>

<p>Vain&mdash;well, with his attractions, hasn't he cause for
it? Unstable as water, he shall not excel; except in the
moment of stress and the tight corner where a hundred
more trusted men might fail, as they did the day he
won the Military Cross, when he took that German
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;390]</span>
trench single-handed, and was found with the enemy,
aghast, surrendering in heaps around him!</p>

<p>His dare-devil gaiety and recklessness are given value
now by the conditions of this war. And I feel that
he will come back to me unscratched at the end of the
struggle, his career assured. It will be luck, his unfailing
luck as usual&mdash;no merit of his!</p>

<p>Meanwhile I wait hopefully.</p>

<p>I feed my heart's hunger, as do so many other women,
on pencilled scraps of letters scrawled across the envelope
"on active service."</p>

<p>As for my living, I haven't gone back to Aunt Anastasia,
nor have I yet solved the weighty problem of
how a woman of my class and requirements is to live
on the separation allowance. Now that Miss Million
has gone back to her old work Mrs. James Burke has
taken another job; well paid, and to a kindly mistress.</p>

<p>Miss Vi Vassity's "dresser" gave notice because she
had been offered higher wages by a French dancer.
And London's Love, who, she says, hates "to see any
strange face putting the liquid white on her shoulders,"
offered the post to "little Smithie."</p>

<p>I accepted.</p>

<p>I live the queer, garish, artificially lighted life of the
theatres now. I dress the hair and change the Paris
frocks, and lace the corsets, and mend the pink silk
fleshings of England's Premier Comedienne.</p>

<p>I am in her dressing-room now, busily folding and
putting away her scattered, scented garments. Even
from here I can catch the roar of applause that goes
up from every part of the theatre as she comes on in
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;391]</span>
that dainty, impertinent travesty of a Highlander's uniform
to sing her latest recruiting song, "The London
Skittish."</p>

<p>To the right of her making-up mirror there stands
a massively framed, full-length photograph of a slim
lad's figure in black tights. It's the picture of that
worthless trick cyclist, who was the love of Vi Vassity's
life.</p>

<p>Ah, Vi! Do you think he is the only man whose
cropped dark hair has felt like velvet beneath a woman's
lips? The only man whose laugh has pierced a woman's
heart "straight as a pebble drops into a pool"?</p>

<p>The woman knows better. I know some one who&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<hr />

<p>Suddenly I saw his dark head, his laughing face in
the mirror before me.</p>

<p>Jim!</p>

<p>I thought I must be dreaming.</p>

<p>I turned; I met his black-lashed blue gaze.</p>

<p>His broad-shouldered, khaki-clad form filled up the
narrow doorway of Vi Vassity's dressing-room.</p>

<p>"Child," he called in the inexpressibly soft Irish
voice.</p>

<p>He held out his arms.</p>

<p>It was he&mdash;my husband.</p>

<p>I ran to him....</p>

<p>"Gently," he said, wincing ever so little. "Mind
my shoulder, now. It's smashed&mdash;more or less completely."</p>

<p>I cried out, seeing now that the jacket hung like a
dolman upon his shoulder. I faltered the thought that
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;392]</span>
would come to any woman. Yes! However brave she
was, however glad to let her man go out to do "his
bit," there is a limit to what she is willing to lose ...
and there are still young and strong and able-bodied
civilians in England, untouched even by a Zeppelin
bomb!</p>

<p>I said: "You can't&mdash;you can't be sent out again?"</p>

<p>"Bad cess to it, no," frowned my husband. "Don't
look so relieved now, or I'll have to feel ashamed of you,
Lady Ballyneck&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What d'you call me?" I asked, not comprehending.
It was some minutes before I did understand what
he said about his dad and his brother Terence, both
"outed" the same day at Neuve Chapelle.</p>

<p>"And ourselves saddled with the God-forsaken castle
and the estate, save the mark," said my husband, Lord
Ballyneck, ruefully. "What we'll do with it until we
let it to Miss Million at a princely rental (as I mean
to) the dear only knows! It's a fine match you've made
for yourself, child, though, when all's said. A title,
at all events. Sure I might have done better for myself,"
he concluded, with his blue eyes, alive with mirth
and tenderness, feasting on my face. "I might have
done better for myself than Miss Million's maid!"</p>
